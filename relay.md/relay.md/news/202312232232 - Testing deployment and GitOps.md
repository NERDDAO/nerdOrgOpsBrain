# Testing deployment and GitOps
## Testing environment
For relay.md we finally have a distinct [test environment](https://test.relay.md) which will come with most recent code base. We expect things to break there, instead of production on [relay.md](https://relay.md).

Let us know if you want to know more about how we operate things on the backend.
## GitOps
Thanks to git hooks and continuous integration and delivery, we finished automating deployments. With this, we get `develop` branch deployed to `test.relay.md`, and once a release is tagged as `v*`, we get a deployment on production. We only need to touch any of this in case we have to modify configuration, e.g. environment variables or secrets.
 
We make use of [gitea](https://gitea.com) and [drone](https://drone.io) for our pipelines.
