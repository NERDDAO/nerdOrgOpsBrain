## üéâ We did it
We finally have a landing page that accurately describes the product with 
* a nice info graphic 
* some bullet points
* a call to action
Also, we decided for a unified color scheme based around a darker pink.

We finally love our own landing page üíù

As for the updates to the product:
* We have refactored the Obsidian plugin to be more modular
* Fixed a bunch of bugs that caused the syncing of files cross the vault to fail
* The Document Viewer on relay.md now accurately presents the teams/topics the document was shared with
* Teaser for the support of more social network logins
* Fixes and improvements for dealing with subscriptions
* Distinct site to show how Obsidian is linked with your relay.md account
* and a ton of smaller bug fixes that make the offering more robust
