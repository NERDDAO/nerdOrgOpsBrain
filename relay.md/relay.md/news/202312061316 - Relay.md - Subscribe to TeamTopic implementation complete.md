# Updates on Relay.md Implementation
Another week, another update about the implementation progress of relay.md.

* [viewer] The viewer now has highligh-js integrated together with showdown for markdown processing
* [documents] Now, public documents can be read without having to log-in
* [obsidian] Single click configuration for the Obsidian plugin. No longer need to manually copy&paste the access-token from the website
* [subscription] Finally implemented a way to (un-)subscribe to team/topics individually and have a site that shows them all for browsing. The `/v1/docs` endpoint used by the Obsidian plugin would now only list those documents that have been shared in any of your subscribed team/topics.
* [plugin] We have received some really good feedback on our Obsidian plugin from the core developers of Obsidian itself and have updated our codebase accordingly. Ideally, the plugin would be approved for inclusion into community plugin repo shortly. We will keep you posted.

Meanwhile, we have started discussion on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/187rq1k/relaymd_sharing_markdown_documents_with_people/) and [forum.obsidian.md](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/relay-md-sharing-documents-with-people-and-teams/72208) and are always looking for feedback from our users. So please take a minute or two and let us know what you think about relay.md. We would much appreciate it!
