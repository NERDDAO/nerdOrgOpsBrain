Dear relayers,

Its time ⏰ for a quick update on the progress of relay.md:

🎉 **More communities**:
We have added Facebook, Twitter/X, and a Telegram group to our site. Join now and engage with the founder and other relayers.

🎉 **Asset Support**:
In the last weeks, we have finalized development, and shipped support for assets (also known as embeds). Just add your files to your note and relay them as usual. The plugin and service will deal with them seemlessly.

🎉 **One-click Obsidian Plugin Configuration**:
We have fine-tuned our one-click plugin configuration site and now cover all use-cases including manual configuration of your Obsidian client.

🎉 **New Obsidian plugin**:
Thanks to our friends in the Obsidian community, we refactored our Obsidian plugin to be easier to extend and maintain. This shed some light onto bugs we have been trying to resolve for a while. Ultimately, our latest release is more stable, more reliable and easier to develop on.

That's it for now. Let's get back to taking notes 💕
