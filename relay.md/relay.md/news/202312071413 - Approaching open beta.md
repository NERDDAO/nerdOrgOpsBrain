# Closing in to the open beta
As we are finishing up the permission scheme for teams and topics, we are approaching our internal public beta release phase.
This will be the point when we open up relay.md to the public, let them register and play around with relay documents.
## Requirements for the Open Beta
* You'll need a **github** account
* Install the `relay-md` plugin (unless this [pull request](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/2734) gets approved and merged)

Once we open up, we will provide a tutorial on getting relay.md configured in your vault.
