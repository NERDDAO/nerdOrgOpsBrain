Based on your notes, here is a step-by-step guide on how to define a new system in a MUD world:
### Step-by-Step Guide to Define a New System in a MUD World
#### Step 1: Create a Namespace
1. **Purpose**: Namespaces help organize and manage the different functionalities within the MUD world.
2. **Action**: Create a namespace for the new functionality.
- Refer to the [namespaces and access control documentation](/world/namespaces-access-control) for detailed instructions.
#### Step 2: Create Tables
1. **Purpose**: Tables store the state data that your system will read from and write to.
2. **Action**: Define the tables needed for your system.
- Refer to the [tables documentation](/world/tables) for guidance on creating and managing tables.
#### Step 3: Implement the System Contract
1. **Purpose**: The system contract contains the business logic for your functionality.
2. **Action**: Implement the `System` contract.
- Ensure that the system is stateless and interacts with the `World` to read and write state from the tables.
- Refer to the [systems documentation](/world/systems) for more details.
#### Step 4: Register Functions
1. **Purpose**: Functions need to be registered so they can be called through the `World`.
2. **Action**: Register the functions of your system.
- Follow the instructions in the [function selectors documentation](/world/function-selectors).
#### Step 5: Set Access Permissions
1. **Purpose**: Control who can access and execute the functions within your system.
2. **Action**: Create any necessary access permissions.
- By default, a `System` has access to its own namespace. Additional permissions can be set as needed.
#### Step 6: Assign Namespace Ownership
1. **Purpose**: Determine who will administer the new namespace.
2. **Action**: Assign ownership of the namespace.
- You can assign it to a user, a multisig, or burn it by assigning it to `address(0)`.
#### Step 7: Follow Best Practices
1. **Purpose**: Ensure your system is designed efficiently and securely.
2. **Action**: Adhere to best practices such as:
- **One call, one action**: Use batch calls for multiple actions instead of combining them into a single function.
- **Use delegation for user agents**: Request users to delegate their permissions if the system will act on their behalf.
- Refer to the [System Best Practices documentation](/world/system-best-practices) for more details.
By following these steps, you can define and implement a new system in a MUD world effectively.

- `getMapData(coordinates)`: Retrieves data about a specific location on the map.
#### Step 4: Register Functions
1. **Purpose**: To make the functions callable through the `World`.
2. **Action**: Register the functions in the `MapSystem` contract.
#### Step 5: Set Access Permissions
1. **Purpose**: To control who can access and modify the map data.
2. **Action**: Set permissions to ensure only authorized entities can modify the map data.
#### Step 6: Assign Namespace Ownership
1. **Purpose**: To determine who will administer the map namespace.
2. **Action**: Assign ownership to a relevant entity or burn it by assigning it to `address(0)`.
### Best Practices
- **One call, one action**: Use batch calls for multiple actions instead of combining them into a single function.
- **Use delegation for user agents**: Request users to delegate their permissions if the system will act on their behalf.
By following these steps, you can effectively implement an inventory and map system in a MUD world.

Based on your notes, here is a detailed guide on how to implement the inventory system for the latest build:
### Step-by-Step Guide to Implement the Inventory System
#### Step 1: Create a Namespace
1. **Purpose**: To organize and manage the inventory functionality.
2. **Action**: Create a namespace called `inventory`.
#### Step 2: Define Tables
1. **Purpose**: To store the state data related to the inventory.
2. **Action**: Create tables for storing items and player inventories.
- **Items Table**: Stores details about each item (e.g., item ID, name, description, attributes).
- **Player Inventory Table**: Stores the inventory of each player (e.g., player ID, list of item IDs).
Example Solidity code for defining tables:
\```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import { Table } from "@latticexyz/world/src/Table.sol";
contract InventoryTables {
Table public itemsTable;
Table public playerInventoryTable;
constructor() {
itemsTable = new Table();
playerInventoryTable = new Table();
}
}
\```
#### Step 3: Implement the Inventory System Contract
1. **Purpose**: To handle the business logic for managing inventories.
2. **Action**: Implement the `InventorySystem` contract.
Example Solidity code for the Inventory System:
\```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import { System } from "@latticexyz/world/src/System.sol";
import { InventoryTables } from "./InventoryTables.sol";
contract InventorySystem is System {
InventoryTables private tables;
constructor(address _tables) {
tables = InventoryTables(_tables);
}
function addItemToInventory(bytes32 playerId, bytes32 itemId) public {
// Logic to add item to player's inventory
tables.playerInventoryTable.set(playerId, itemId);
}
function removeItemFromInventory(bytes32 playerId, bytes32 itemId) public {
// Logic to remove item from player's inventory
tables.playerInventoryTable.remove(playerId, itemId);
}
function getInventory(bytes32 playerId) public view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
// Logic to get player's inventory
return tables.playerInventoryTable.get(playerId);
}
}
\```
#### Step 4: Register Functions
1. **Purpose**: To make the functions callable through the `World`.
2. **Action**: Register the functions in the `InventorySystem` contract.
Example code for registering functions:
\```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import { WorldRegistrationSystem } from "@latticexyz/world/src/modules/core/implementations/WorldRegistrationSystem.sol";
import { InventorySystem } from "./InventorySystem.sol";
contract RegisterInventorySystem {
function register(address world, address inventorySystem) public {
WorldRegistrationSystem(world).registerSystem("inventory", inventorySystem);
}
}
\```
#### Step 5: Set Access Permissions
1. **Purpose**: To control who can access and modify the inventory.
2. **Action**: Set permissions to ensure only authorized entities can modify the inventory.
Example code for setting permissions:
\```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import { AccessControl } from "@latticexyz/world/src/AccessControl.sol";
contract InventoryAccessControl is AccessControl {
constructor() {
// Set up initial permissions
}
function grantAccess(address account) public {
_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, account);
}
function revokeAccess(address account) public {
_revokeRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, account);
}
}
\```
#### Step 6: Assign Namespace Ownership
1. **Purpose**: To determine who will administer the inventory namespace.
2. **Action**: Assign ownership to a relevant entity or burn it by assigning it to `address(0)`.
Example code for assigning namespace ownership:
\```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract AssignNamespaceOwnership {
function assignOwnership(address world, bytes32 namespace, address newOwner) public {
World(world).setNamespaceOwner(namespace, newOwner);
}
}
\```
### Best Practices
- **One call, one action**: Use batch calls for multiple actions instead of combining them into a single function.
- **Use delegation for user agents**: Request users to delegate their permissions if the system will act on their behalf.
By following these steps, you can effectively implement the inventory system for the latest build in your MUD world.
