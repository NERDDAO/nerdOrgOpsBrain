**Daily Coordination Newsletter - April 25, 2024**
Good morning, team! Here's your daily dose of updates, progress, and reminders to kickstart your day.
**Project Updates:**
- **Locastic:**
  - Carolina has provided the requested data. We are currently awaiting further updates from the team. The progress on the project selector field for event & job forms is ongoing.
- **Solidant:**
  - Carlos was unable to attend the weekly meeting due to travel commitments. A brainstorming session on scoring and integration with index.network is upcoming. The team is encouraged to review the DSW requirements document.
- **nerdDAO:**
  - Our collaboration with Lemonade has been approved. Despite facing challenges such as tight deadlines and Ecuador's electricity issues, we are continuing our work on the index for frame integration with Lemonade.
**Relay.md Updates:**
- We've added Facebook, Twitter/X, and a Telegram group to our site. Join to engage with the founder and other relayers.
- Development and support for assets (embeds) have been finalized and shipped. The one-click Obsidian Plugin Configuration site has been fine-tuned to cover all use-cases.
- Our Obsidian plugin has been refactored for easier extension and maintenance, leading to a more stable and reliable release.
**Meetings & Operations:**
- A workshop about using Obsidian for internal organization was conducted by At0x, discussing the benefits and handicaps. A daily report telegram channel will be created.
- An informal meeting with At0x discussed project states and objectives, emphasizing the need to improve our NERDs Obsidian and planning a meeting between At0x, Raquel, and Matti for finished projects.
- A template for grants applications has been created, and the GG20 grant application process has started. A folder for Grants Applications and Social Media on Obsidian has also been established.
**Development:**
- The Donations Frame project is nearing completion, with a pending query about the byte data formation awaiting response from the donation frame team.
**Reminders:**
- Please ensure to review any pending documents, especially the DSW requirements document for the Solidant team.
- Stay tuned for the upcoming brainstorming session details and ensure your participation.
Let's keep the momentum going and make today productive. For any immediate concerns or to share updates, please reach out through our designated channels.

That's all for today's coordination newsletter. Let's make it a great day ahead!
Best,
