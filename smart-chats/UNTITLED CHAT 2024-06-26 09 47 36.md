Based on your notes, while they don't directly address the specific task you've mentioned, I can help you formulate a plan for creating a procedural newsletter that aggregates nerd news using the NerdClub's infrastructure and community-driven approach. Here's a suggested plan:

1. Objective: Create a weekly procedural newsletter that aggregates nerd news, leveraging the NerdClub's AI services and community engagement.

2. Coordination Engine: Utilize the NerdClub's integration with Farcaster and its AI services to automate the collection and curation of nerd news.

3. How:
   a. Cannoli: Implement Cannoli, presumably an AI-powered tool, to scan and aggregate relevant nerd news from various sources across the internet.
   b. Bounty Program: Establish a community-driven bounty program within the NerdClub ecosystem, incentivizing members to submit high-quality articles or news items.
   c. AI Curation: Use the NerdClub's AI services to analyze, categorize, and prioritize the collected news items and submitted articles.
   d. NFT-Based Rewards: Implement an NFT-based reward system for top contributors, aligning with the NerdClub's subscription model.

4. When: Release the newsletter every Friday, establishing a regular schedule for the community to anticipate and engage with.

5. Implementation Steps:
   - Set up the technical infrastructure using the NerdClub's servers and AI models.
   - Develop the Cannoli tool or integrate it with existing AI services.
   - Create a user-friendly interface for bounty submissions, possibly using the Frog framework for enhanced UX.
   - Establish clear guidelines and criteria for the bounty program.
   - Design an automated workflow for news aggregation, curation, and newsletter compilation.
   - Test the system thoroughly before launch.
   - Promote the newsletter within the NerdClub community and on the Farcaster platform.

This approach aligns with the NerdClub's goals of community engagement, innovative AI application, and creating value within its ecosystem. It also leverages the project's technical infrastructure and subscription model to create a unique, community-driven nerd news aggregation service.
