Based on your notes, I'll create haiku summaries for the main subjects mentioned in the Introduction:

World:
Central entry point
Access control and logic
Data's gatekeeper

Store:
Low-level storage
Primitives for the foundation
World builds upon it

System:
Stateless contracts
Perform authorized actions
Through World's watchful eye

Tables:
Data's resting place
Managed by World, accessed through
Systems with care

Namespaces:
Claim unused spaces
Extend the world as you wish
Permissionless growth

Access Control:
Guardian of data
World checks each call carefully
Before granting rights

Diamond Pattern:
Facets and Systems
Similar yet different paths
World allows freedom
