Based on your notes, the error you're encountering is due to the `get` function not being defined within your Zustand store. In Zustand, to access the current state within a store method, you should use the `get` function provided by the store's API.
Here's how you can fix the issue:
1. Modify the store definition to include the `get` function in the store's creation.

```typescript
import create from "zustand";interface Player {  id: string;  name: string;  x: number;  y: number;  health: number;}interface Lore {  id: string;  title: string;  content: string;}interface PlayerStore {  playerName: string;  players: Player[];  lore: Lore[];  setPlayerName: (name: string) => void;  setPlayers: (players: Player[]) => void;  addPlayer: (player: Player) => void;  setLore: (lore: Lore[]) => void;  addLore: (lore: Lore) => void;  getLore: (playerId: string) => Lore | undefined;}export const usePlayerStore = create<PlayerStore>((set, get) => ({  playerName: "",  players: [],  lore: [],  setPlayerName: name => set({ playerName: name }),  setPlayers: players => set({ players }),  addPlayer: player => set(state => ({ players: [...state.players, player] })),  setLore: lore => set({ lore }),  addLore: lore => set(state => ({ lore: [...state.lore, lore] })),  getLore: playerId => get().lore.find(l => l.id === playerId), // Implement this method}));In this corrected version, the `get` function is passed as the second argument to the store's creation function, allowing you to access the current state within the `getLore` method.This should resolve the `ReferenceError: get is not defined` error you're encountering.
