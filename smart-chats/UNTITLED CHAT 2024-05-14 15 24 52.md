Based on your notes, here's a step-by-step guide to start a blank world by spawning entities in MUD:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed. You might need tools like `mud-cli` for generating and deploying your world.

2. **Create a New Namespace**:
   - Namespaces help in organizing and managing access control. Create a namespace for your new world.
   ```solidity
   // Example: Creating a namespace
   World.createNamespace("myWorldNamespace");
   ```

3. **Define Tables**:
   - Tables are used to store the state of your entities. Define the tables you need for your entities.
   ```solidity
   // Example: Creating a table for entities
   World.createTable("myWorldNamespace", "Entities", ["id", "name", "type"]);
   ```

4. **Implement Systems**:
   - Systems contain the business logic for interacting with your entities. Implement systems to handle entity creation, updates, and other interactions.
   ```solidity
   // Example: System to spawn entities
   contract EntitySystem is System {
       function spawnEntity(uint256 id, string memory name, string memory entityType) public {
           // Logic to add entity to the table
           World.write("myWorldNamespace", "Entities", id, [name, entityType]);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Register Systems**:
   - Register your systems with the `World` so they can be called.
   ```solidity
   // Example: Registering the system
   World.registerSystem("myWorldNamespace", "EntitySystem", new EntitySystem());
   ```

6. **Set Up Access Control**:
   - Define who can interact with your systems. By default, a system has access to its own namespace.
   ```solidity
   // Example: Setting access control
   World.setAccessControl("myWorldNamespace", "EntitySystem", msg.sender);
   ```

7. **Deploy Your World**:
   - Use the `mud-cli` to deploy your world to the blockchain.
   ```bash
   mud deploy
   ```

8. **Interact with Your World**:
   - Once deployed, you can start interacting with your world by calling the registered systems.
   ```solidity
   // Example: Spawning an entity
   World.call("myWorldNamespace", "EntitySystem", "spawnEntity", [1, "Goblin", "Monster"]);
   ```

By following these steps, you will have a basic setup for a blank world with the ability to spawn entities. You can extend this by adding more tables, systems, and logic as needed.
