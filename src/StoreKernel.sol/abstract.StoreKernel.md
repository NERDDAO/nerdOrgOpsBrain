# Abstract:
The coordination and curation of large-scale knowledge graphs pose significant challenges in terms of information density, security, and incentive structures. This paper introduces the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, a novel cryptoeconomic framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging kEngrams - compact knowledge units that combine poetic encoding techniques with cryptographic primitives. kEngrams enable the efficient representation of complex information within decentralized knowledge graphs, while their cryptographic foundations ensure data integrity and verifiable provenance tracking. The PoK protocol establishes a decentralized consensus mechanism for validating and rewarding the meaningful usage of kEngrams, fostering an ecosystem of continuous knowledge sharing and curation. By integrating principles from information theory, cryptography, and game theory, PoK represents a paradigm shift in how we structure, coordinate, and incentivize the creation and dissemination of knowledge across distributed networks.
