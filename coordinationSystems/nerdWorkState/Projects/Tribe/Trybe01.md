Based on your notes, the gameplay mechanisms of "Tribe by Nerds" incorporate a blend of survival, role-playing, and innovative AI-driven narrative elements within a text-based MMORPG framework. Here's a summary of the core gameplay mechanisms:

1. **AI-Driven Narrative via Haikus**:
   - The game utilizes AI to dynamically generate narrative content in the form of haikus. These haikus serve as a unique storytelling medium and a method for maintaining game coherence, updating the game state based on player actions and decisions. Players must interpret and react to these poetic cues to navigate the game world, making survival decisions that impact their progress.

2. **Survival and Resource Management**:
   - Players are tasked with surviving in a harsh environment, requiring careful management of resources. This includes gathering food, crafting tools, and building shelters, akin to traditional survival games. The twist comes from the narrative cues provided by haikus, which guide players through these survival challenges in a more immersive and narrative-driven way.

3. **Scenario Management and Gameplay Loop**:
   - A separate module or contract generates scenarios based on the current state of the tribe and available artifacts. This system ensures that the game world and its challenges remain dynamic and responsive to player actions.
   - The gameplay loop involves receiving scenarios, making decisions in response, and seeing those decisions' outcomes reflected in the game world. This includes updates to the Trybe and Artifact contracts, which track tribe attributes and artifact ownership, respectively.

4. **Dynamic Content and User Interface**:
   - The game leverages an updated ontology and interface architecture to dynamically generate engaging content that remains relevant to the evolving game state. This ensures a coherent and immersive narrative experience.
   - A user-friendly interface allows players to easily interact with game mechanics, particularly for managing artifacts and making strategic decisions in response to scenarios.

5. **Multiplayer Interactions**:
   - While not explicitly detailed in the notes, the mention of a multiplayer MMORPG framework implies interactions with other players. This could involve trading, forming alliances, or competing for resources, all within the narrative context provided by the AI-generated haikus.

6. **Integration Between Contracts and Gameplay**:
   - The game's technical backbone involves smart contracts (Trybe and Artifact contracts) and a Scenario Management module that work together to create a seamless gameplay experience. These systems manage the game's data flow, scenario outcomes, and player decisions, ensuring that the narrative and game state dynamically evolve based on player interactions.

"Tribe by Nerds" aims to redefine the survival MMORPG genre by integrating text-based gameplay with AI-driven narrative techniques, offering players a deeply immersive and innovative experience. Through its unique use of haikus for storytelling and scenario management, the game encourages players to engage with the narrative and each other in meaningful ways, shaping the game world with their decisions.
