Based on your notes, here is a step-by-step guide on how to define a new system in a MUD world:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Define a New System in a MUD World

#### Step 1: Create a Namespace
1. **Purpose**: Namespaces help organize and manage the different functionalities within the MUD world.
2. **Action**: Create a namespace for the new functionality.
   - Refer to the [namespaces and access control documentation](/world/namespaces-access-control) for detailed instructions.

#### Step 2: Create Tables
1. **Purpose**: Tables store the state data that your system will read from and write to.
2. **Action**: Define the tables needed for your system.
   - Refer to the [tables documentation](/world/tables) for guidance on creating and managing tables.

#### Step 3: Implement the System Contract
1. **Purpose**: The system contract contains the business logic for your functionality.
2. **Action**: Implement the `System` contract.
   - Ensure that the system is stateless and interacts with the `World` to read and write state from the tables.
   - Refer to the [systems documentation](/world/systems) for more details.

#### Step 4: Register Functions
1. **Purpose**: Functions need to be registered so they can be called through the `World`.
2. **Action**: Register the functions of your system.
   - Follow the instructions in the [function selectors documentation](/world/function-selectors).

#### Step 5: Set Access Permissions
1. **Purpose**: Control who can access and execute the functions within your system.
2. **Action**: Create any necessary access permissions.
   - By default, a `System` has access to its own namespace. Additional permissions can be set as needed.

#### Step 6: Assign Namespace Ownership
1. **Purpose**: Determine who will administer the new namespace.
2. **Action**: Assign ownership of the namespace.
   - You can assign it to a user, a multisig, or burn it by assigning it to `address(0)`.

#### Step 7: Follow Best Practices
1. **Purpose**: Ensure your system is designed efficiently and securely.
2. **Action**: Adhere to best practices such as:
   - **One call, one action**: Use batch calls for multiple actions instead of combining them into a single function.
   - **Use delegation for user agents**: Request users to delegate their permissions if the system will act on their behalf.
   - Refer to the [System Best Practices documentation](/world/system-best-practices) for more details.

By following these steps, you can define and implement a new system in a MUD world effectively.
