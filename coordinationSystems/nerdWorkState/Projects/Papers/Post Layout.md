 
Talking points:
- Define space
- Space as a container for things
- 1 Space paradigm... expanding the boundaries of space = age of discovery
- 2 space paradigm... enter the cyberspace = digital worlds, social media, the internet
- 3 space problem... enter the hyperspace = the metaverse, semantic worldbuilding, 
3.a What is the hyperspace?
Is the interoperable collection of vectorized embeddings

3.b isnt this just "more internet?"
No, because embeddings enable passive awareness of its content and allows the user to experience it dynamically by combining his local context with the product.

3b.1 Why is hyperspace differet than cyberspace?

Cyberspace relies on explicit linking of its content through hyperlinks and requires the user to explicitly find and come up with their own queries or rely on a centralized provider of content. Hyperspace is a 3d represetation of high dimensional semantic space which can topologically arrange content passively and therefore allow for discovery to happen as an emergent property of the system.

By designing embedding surfaces explicitly to achieve a goal one can create highly structured embedding spaces which serve a specific purpose and serve as substrucutres in a larger surface of understanding that can be composed in a number of ways. 

When thinking about embedding based products I often struggle with the dichotomy of having to use 3d abstractions to be able to comprehend and convey the goals of embedding topology design while at the same time understanding the inherent differences in behaviour of high dimensional space. However, this premise makes alot more sense in the context of space travel. 

A LLM is like a spaceship nav computer plotting a jump to warp speed. It has to calculate the correct route through asteroid fields, black holes and stars with a vector that reaches the intended destination. Whenever you ask something to a LLM it plots a route from your question to the next word of the answer repeating until its satisfied. When designing embedding spaces I try to imagine myself creating paths through space through which these vectors will on average prefer to traverse to get to specific outcomes.

Unlike cyberspace, where everything is explicitly defined by the code, hyperspace design is more akin to landscaping where you can only indirectly alter the outcome of things. In fact the hyperspace itself is projected into the cyberspace from which we can interact with representations of the embedding space. 

## Landscaping Hyperspace

What are the tools of the hyper-gardener? There is but one rule in all of data science. Garbage in, Garbage Out.  The main goal of embedding design is to ensure the input data is sufficient to achieve the intended goal. Define what types of data inputs are required and what indicators are going computed from that data.

Some questions that you will need to answer:

Who is gong to write to the data? 
Where is the data going to be stored?
Who is going to read the data?
How is the data going to be shown?

By answering these questions you can define what the pipeline is going to look like. And at the same time you can understand the different areas that you can optimize to achieve the intended results.

We can break the process in 3 distinct steps:

-> Data entry
Define access control, Ontologies and type definitions
Create interfaces that allow for seamless data entry

-> Data processing
Normalize data into pre defined ontologies
analyze data and append reports
create embeddings of input

-> Data reading
Find appropiate context for result generation
Semantic expansion of  normalized data
Facilitate sharing and collective action

In order to create a useful embedding space all these must work together seamlessly into a unified solution. 

## RAG and self learning

 
One thing of note is that embedding spaces can be cold started and improved just by using them as intended. Once the pipelines are established the functions that utilize RAG will adjust their outputs based on previous examples. Meaning that as a hyper-gardener one can prune the available embeddings which have good outputs to generate more good examples that stabilize the embedding space into the desired shape. 

In practice this creates an embedding sourdough which you can utilize across many interfaces to grow into a coherent embedding space which then you can use as a launchpad for more contrived ideas. I wager that embedding designers will be advertising their base embeddings ase their core product offering. Another interesting fact about embedding databases is that they're very propietary in the sense that only those that have a deep understanding of their content can really use them appropiately. It is much better in my opinion to start a new embedding database for yourself which fosters more unique cultures of embeddings.



Much work is currently being done to "stitch" embedding spaces together and i think its only a matter of time before this is a reality. The nature of high dimensional space allows embedding sets to more or less live on top of each other as long as they are coherent with each other. 

## Embedding space visualizations

This is something that is going to help inmensely in the area of embedding space design. I havent yet tried to explicitly visualize embedding spaces but i really wanna XD
