Experiment: Measuring Coherence in a Knowledge Graph through Vector Embedding Analysis

Objective:
To quantify the coherence of a knowledge graph by analyzing the consistency, relevance, and patterns of vector embedding retrievals over time.

Method:
1. Setup:
   - Implement a knowledge graph using kEngrams as the basic units.
   - Develop a system for vector embedding generation and retrieval.

2. Data Collection:
   - Over a predetermined number of steps regularly introduce new information into the knowledge graph.
   - Conduct periodic queries after each step on a set of predefined topics.
   - For each query, retrieve the top N (e.g., 10) most relevant kEngrams based on vector similarity.

3. Analysis:
   a. Relevance Scoring:
      - Have domain experts rate the relevance of retrieved kEngrams on a scale of 1-5.
      - Calculate average relevance scores for each query over time.

   b. Similarity Measurement:
      - Compute cosine similarity between retrieved vector embeddings for each query.
      - Track changes in similarity scores over time.

   c. Pattern Recognition:
      - Employ clustering algorithms to identify emergent patterns in retrieval results.
      - Analyze the stability and evolution of these clusters over the experimental period.

4. Coherence Metrics:
   - Define a composite coherence score based on:
     i. Average relevance of retrieved kEngrams
     ii. Consistency of similarity scores
     iii. Stability and meaningfulness of emergent clusters

5. Temporal Analysis:
   - Plot coherence metrics over time to visualize the evolution of system coherence.
   - Identify key events or changes in the knowledge graph that correlate with shifts in coherence.

Expected Outcomes:
- A quantitative measure of knowledge graph coherence over time.
- Insights into the self-organizing properties of the stigmergic hyperstructure.
- Visualization of emergent patterns in the knowledge ecosystem.

This experiment would provide valuable data on the effectiveness of the kEngram-based knowledge graph in maintaining coherence while adapting to new information. It would also offer insights into the system's self-organization capabilities and the emergence of meaningful structures within the hyperstructure.
