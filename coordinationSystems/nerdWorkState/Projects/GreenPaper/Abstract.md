# Abstract:  
This paper introduces the kEngram knowledge primitive and Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, a revolutionary approach to decentralized, secure, and incentivized knowledge management. This system addresses the challenges of large-scale knowledge coordination by leveraging synergies between information theory, cryptography, distributed systems, game theory, and knowledge representation. The kEngram ecosystem aims to create a self-sustaining environment for collaborative construction and curation of comprehensive knowledge graphs, with applications spanning research, education, enterprise knowledge management, and content creation. By fostering collaboration, transparency, and shared ownership of knowledge assets, this system has the potential to accelerate scientific progress, enable personalized learning experiences, streamline knowledge transfer, and unlock new models for attribution and monetization.
