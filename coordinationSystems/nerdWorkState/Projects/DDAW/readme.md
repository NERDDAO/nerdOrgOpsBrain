# DDAW.xyz  
## The Decentralized Digital Audio Workstation

[REPO](https://github.com/ivcained/DDAW)

Built with Open Source Technologies. Artists / Producers can create tracks and with a click be able to mint their creations and set royalty in code through Unique Audio + Video NFTs.

## Buy & Sell Samples, Beats, Arrangements on Chain

On mint, the DDAW will generate a unique NFT by making a mix down and adjusting the Channel Levels and FX Sends and a Master Bus Channel based on the time of mint and wallet address autonomously until 512 NFTs are Minted on Base (OPStack, L2) and Ethereum (L1)

## Music Studio On Chain

The tracks will be put individually on our own custom version of Helicon: forked from tr666eth/helicon A library for making music with web audio. It was developed as part of the audioglyphs project, but we hope that it will be useful to others working on similar things.

## Works on majority Browsers

Lossless Audio Processing
FX, One Button Remix, Mint straight from the DAW!

## Keep projects on schedule

It aims to use native web audio APIs as directly as possible and to be general purpose - avoiding including any specific audio processing or sequencing code in favor of things that apply to any project and any style of music.

##Program your royalties in code (NFTs)

The DDAW will allow artists to set royalties in code through Unique Audio + Video NFTs.
Create instant Visualization of Sound and Mint A/V NFTs
Control every Channel and modulate FX, Sends and Level Automation or let the DDAW AI decide or ask it for a style.

Anyone can submit feedback, use the code, add to the code, make proposals to the DAO.
