### Reputation Score and Incentives
- Discussed the reputation score system and how incentives tied to these scores would be pushed on-chain [02:03].
- Mentioned the relationship between reputation scores and user disputes, and the need to ensure that disputes don't push incentives [02:03].
- Talked about creating a basic system to test out as a version zero, aiming for simplicity to validate assumptions [03:14].
- Considered the cost implications of pushing data on-chain and the need to go back to the drawing board if costs are prohibitive [03:14].
- Agreed on the potential success of the proposed system but acknowledged the need to push Merkle roots on-chain periodically [04:40].
- Discussed using ceramic streams to guarantee data integrity and the idea of generating a Merkle tree once per day to push data on-chain [05:20].
- Explored the concept of tracking queries and embeddings that are commonly used to allow real-time reactions [07:26].
- Mentioned the idea of tipping mechanisms as a way to forward tokens for providing good knowledge [08:25].
- Talked about the importance of knowing which information is "hot" or queried frequently to create related content [09:50].
- Discussed the potential for a reputation system to be built on top of the core build and the need for a filter through tags to determine the value of points issued [14:28].
- Emphasized the desire for a simple baseline system with the possibility of adding complexity through multipliers or bonuses [15:30].
- Highlighted the need for a robust protocol that is as unopinionated as possible to allow for a wide range of applications [17:20].
- Discussed the role of research collectives in applying complexity and distributing incentives [18:00].
- Mentioned the need to test the efficiency of the system and work on top of it before adding more layers of complexity [20:40].
- Explored the idea of requiring a certain amount of reputation before earning points and the possibility of slashing points for malicious activity [21:40].

### Technical Implementation and API
- Discussed the technical aspects of implementing the reputation score and incentives system [23:30].
- Talked about the need to decouple scores from the actual count of how often a specific embedding is used [24:40].
- Mentioned the possibility of creating two trees to decouple scores and incentives [25:00].
- Discussed the challenge of encoding the score into the system and the need for an abstract implementation [25:00].
- Explored the idea of using ceramic streams and API keys to authenticate interfaces [26:00].
- Considered the potential for the proof of knowledge API to be a revenue stream [27:40].
- Agreed on the need to collect as much metadata as possible for future iterations and the possibility of adjusting the scoring system later on [28:50].
- Discussed the possibility of creating new embeddings daily to summarize the most popular or blacklisted engrams [29:50].
- Talked about the need for a mechanism to prefer embeddings with higher scores and the potential for manual intervention [30:40].
- Mentioned the need to communicate with Status regarding the model and schema for integration [32:00].
- Discussed the potential for on-chain voting and the use of solutions like Snapshot for governance [33:10].

### Governance and Organizational Structure
- Briefly touched on the topic of governance and organizational structure [34:00].
- Planned to review the requirements document and discuss governance in more detail in a future meeting [34:00].
- Aimed to coordinate with the team to ensure all relevant parties, including "demon" (another Carlos), can attend the next meeting [34:00].
