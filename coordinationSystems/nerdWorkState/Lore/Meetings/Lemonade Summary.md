During the meeting, Joshua, Carlos, and Casey discussed the progress and plans for integrating the proof of knowledge protocol into Lemonade. Joshua emphasized the need to set realistic expectations for what can be provided in terms of quality and functionality. Carlos then presented the work they have been doing on creating a framework for users to engage with and create content, such as haikus and songs. He explained how this framework can be used to capture user engagement and create a curated index of information. The goal is to create a system that allows for micro-coordination and serendipitous moments of knowledge sharing. 

Casey expressed his excitement for the project and his willingness to integrate the framework into Lemonade. He mentioned the importance of utility and engagement in the crypto community, and how this framework could help achieve that. Joshua agreed and highlighted the potential for the system to facilitate coordination and collaboration around knowledge types. He mentioned the need to connect people with the right knowledge and create a feedback loop where conversations and new knowledge can be put back into the system. 

Casey offered to integrate the framework into Lemonade and mentioned the possibility of partnering with Air Stock for additional support. He expressed his willingness to integrate whatever features are needed and emphasized the importance of building something that has a real impact. Carlos agreed and mentioned that they will provide an API for querying the index and shared templates for a newsletter feature. They discussed the possibility of integrating the framework with Forecaster and Lemonade's existing features, such as connecting accounts and allowing users to cast directly from inside the app. 

Overall, the meeting was productive and all parties expressed enthusiasm for the project and its potential impact on knowledge sharing and coordination.
