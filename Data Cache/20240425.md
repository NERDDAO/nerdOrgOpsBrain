than better than the last two years? To be honest? They are they have better organization, more aggressive. The prices are really reasonable. Now as Montreal perspective, again, we have a lot of politics here. Right so what three Montreal? John Luke is doing his best but like there is no our can say that we don't have a strong structure here. I try to integrate different community like like Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Montreal. defier Montreal. You know, ethereal Montreal, they're not so present, unfortunately. So and I realized something like it's like a small effort. Everyone is like no, we don't want to we are focusing in Bitcoin we cannot talk about something else and super protective you know, I think guys like give me a chance let's let's talk about something different let's change people let's ask them if they are open to know more about different technologies different blockchain are no no no, no, no, no, no, we don't need that. So I'm facing a strong resistance, strong resistance and material and and between you and I'm losing a little bit motivation because I'm looking for meaning. I'm doing that for community. Yeah, I don't give a shit man. I'm not paid for that. You know, if I spend an hour my hours 500 bucks I would make more money. Yeah. Brother. Yeah. So that's why I'm asking if if you know certain startup like Nigerian visibility, put them in touch with me. Just I will negotiate more. We are easier for me to negotiate something.
Yeah. I mean on that respect on that for like, I've been busy, so I haven't had any events, all kinds of stuff. But if you ever need help, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I'd love to your brother. Especially the community aspect like I'd love to to help out.
Thank you so much. Yes, yes. So I will need help for sure. Okay. Yeah.
Hi, brother. You have a fantastic day. You too, man. You too. It
was a pleasure to talk to you. Oh, Take care man and keep your beautiful smile. I will thank you, brother. Bye bye. Bye.

Yes, for the for the for the consultation for the cost for the VIP quantum Yes, the contract and the protocol will be built on ICP first, and after that, it will be an open source one. The idea is to develop dynamic smart contract, and to be able to we start nailing it in solidity Yeah, so you see what I mean? So after that estimated, this is like Aetherium one this is like in an in the next few years, it will be a standard that's the ambition we have now.
I mean, like me, maybe it's my lack of understanding but it does to me it doesn't really So like for example, we were launching our token on on on Aetherium. But none of our technical infrastructure like it doesn't matter. Really. Yes, whatever. Blockchain allows for high throughput transactions. The data itself is not necessarily living is that living on chain? So it's not the same kind of thing. Right. So So, to me, it doesn't really matter. I'm just kind of I was just curious, why ICP. And in terms of people asking me, yes, because a lot of people like a lot of other folks out there. We're talking about how all this stuff we're choosing a theorem or we're choosing x amount of chain and we're minting it on chain, but the data itself, in that instance, lives on chain, but it doesn't need to live on chain like it doesn't really think that's true. But I think especially in this instance, when there's not going to be a secondary independent market, then everything's gonna have to run through a particular marketplace. And it doesn't it doesn't matter what.
Okay, it's nice to know. Nice to know. Yeah. Yeah. make total sense, man. I totally agree. All right. I agree. I agree. So
yeah, let me I mean, like I said, we're still on one hand, we're still in limbo. Yes. Not in limbo, where we're like progressing, but it's it just takes time. So let me circle back when those things are a little bit done. If I can get the I'd love to get the transcript of this talk. Of course, have an internal coordination tool that we're using to develop to like define the partnerships that we're going to pursue. And if I have this, I can put this I can upload this into our system into our automated system. It'll just live there. So it'll everybody will be able to see in our equal in our team will be able to see this conversation and then we'll be able to iterate off of it.
Sounds good. That sounds great. I'm really happy like let's keep in touch. Have a safe flight. I wish you the best man all my support. And and yeah, before I forget, if you know straight to startup you want them you want me to support them, excuse me from Montreal scientist. I would be honored to push them because I'm fighting now to collect startup from Montreal to go to go to the futurist. Right. And I tried to negotiate with st and accelerator incubator to invest in a big booth. This is Montreal booth. Yeah, man. We need more visibility like so. How's that?
How's future is going? Is it is it coming together? Well is like what's the better

I would like to I think okay, so I mean, yeah, for sure. I'd like to I'd like to help with that. We are almost done our technical products. I mean, almost done. The goal is to have like at least the the minimal usable product of this in the next two months or so. Yes. We will have hopefully finished our next raise from by that time. And then with that next raise, our goal will start to be seeding micro grants into the ecosystem, right? We're actually partnering we have we have a new head of Mexico who is very, very, very prolific and very, very busy in terms of getting us in conversation and in contact with an actual institutions based in in Mexico, so I don't know how much your your jurisdiction covers, like, I guess Mexico still in North America, but like North and South America. But this being like a primary partnership, on launch to say, you can call them and you can commit your data online. You can you know, our frameworks called Proof of knowledge. You can do all that kind of stuff. But if you also want to lever the traditional a traditional S system in terms where you do want to file patents, then IP in addition to this, then here is one of our primary partners. Here's an option out of the here's our major optionality currently in our ecosystem, which will just divert towards what you guys are doing. Like I would love for that to be the way moving forward. And that was my idea, originally to when we had first talked about this with Josh, like, there's one other IP group, but it's not this. Like it's it's, it's kind of like superficial bullshit. And so this is what I'd like to integrate. More will integrate with them because they're part of the ecosystem and whatever, but there'll be more for the people on the ground to understand and this is something that I can bring to institutions and just to scientists and be like, Listen, this levers, it leverages web three type things like tokenization and whatever but fundamentally it's to your point backed and robust, legally. And there's a tree team of people who you can trust as a team of people who you can call or you can get in contact with and it's it's none of the it's none of the hype. It has actual fundamentals in the foundation. Exactly. Oh, like for me, it's a no brainer, for sure. And I've spoken to John, I've spoken to the team about it enough time, I think. I think now it's at the point where we're like we're lagging behind, but we're not lagging behind. We're just not finished yet. But as soon as we're finished or as we start to finish off and polish off. We'd love to have this be one of our specific like strategic partnerships on launch saying we're leveraging is a big quantum where art is you
so VIP content with with ICP is the protocol, or tissue is for listing the marketplace and the listing. So why why I split them because it's actually strategic because ICP they are honestly I've tried a lot of different blockchains and I find them the most serious honestly, to share with you honest feedback. So I find and explore really, really well deeply the canister and the Motoko language we have challenged to to to learn more about that. But now I can say like it's it's a strong base to to build the protocol Aetherium is always the we start with Aetherium so there is no secret but today we need to diversify and explore different platforms for the well being of creative, right and our users. I think that's the focus. So, yeah, VIP content will be the lawyer, the legal assistant, and the ambition is to go through probably a Dao with ICP, to support more startup more scientist redistribute, right help them. This is your IP now you can raise money and the right way. Right. So
that's that so what do you leverage? Sorry, okay, maybe what do you leverage IP ICP for? Are the contracts minted on ICP?

**Forwarded from [Jelani | DeSciWorld | Will never ask for Crypto/Money](https://t.me/Oakenshadow)**

Yeah, it has to be a gradual like a gradual progression towards these kinds of things. Right. So. So then in that instance, when I if I come and invest in research data, yes, I'd sign the contract. I get an NFT. Yes, the NFT I imagine represents my stake or tokenized contract for that asset. Yes. That I know just kind of curious that that NFT in those contracts actually exist separately like they you know, they're nested but they exist separately. I can sell can I sell like because you said the there's open for a sec for secondary markets. Yes, what happens when I go or if somebody says, Okay, I'm going to sell this NFT but not actually hand over the contract. Great. How does that how does that work? Great
question. Actually, what we tried to do and we need to set the voting for that without the community because if we want respecting the complete process, unfortunately, there is no cross chain platform yet. So we are building that for the next two years. You like you see Aetherium polygon Algor and polka dot ICP now radix for validation or so there is crazy work going but in waiting we need to make people probably exchange in our marketplace for now, because it's a unique way J to keep the traceability and be able to transfer for real. The conventional contract
Yes
Right. It's not and and financial authorities. Of course, I'm sorry to say that between you and I they they have they have like the limited knowledge superly which when we said if I'm a collector, I won't buy the asset only with my mind wallet I don't care about like conventional contract. And it's an amount less than $1,000 Oh yeah, it's different depends. I said no, we're going to respect all regulation. So what what are you gonna say for that? They said okay, no problem, but we cannot give you a write a letter.
That's okay. Yeah.
So now why I had challenges because we put crazy money to back the platform solid legally. Because when people trust us and like now, I can share with you something confidential. Also there is this Edward Lama. I don't know if you hear about them, they organize like your solar and digital event. We're going to list 600 NF T's for them. So keep it between you and I. We are launching an event with them for launching. Thank you so much regulation, sir.
That is amazing. There's so much so
what they what they buy from us is the security. Right? Local platform. This is our lawyers. This is the contract. This is the process. So we back everything. Yeah. Oh, what I need is some visibility I need like why I told you last time when we had the conversation I said you know, Jay, let me prove you like we are advanced. And we work hard to make what we say. idea now is to have small like help honestly to have visibility. Why not have a proof of concept project with decide to say okay, we have like this small grant. Let's work with scientists to make it super simple. And you know, push, push, push, you know, that's what I tried to do. Yeah, so

and reality you decide to fractionalize for example, 20% of your IP to raise 100 games give a simple number that you're going to calculate how many tokens you're going to need to raise 100k That's to make it simple standard talking right? With 100 H. So we got on this standard token giving like each percentage of these 20% With limitation because we want keep it as a doll process approach. So when you buy it, as an investor, you're going to buy a limited amount and you receive your PDF contract. You don't have to be super crypto knowledgeable. And that's super easy. That's what we use, for example, cross meant today for a custodial to make you use all your email and your credit card to invest. And you're actually the better marketplace is really also I'll show you an exclusive I'm super excited man because we didn't talk since a while yeah, agenda I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jelani I'm bombarding you with a lot of things. No,
this is great.
Here we go. So yeah, now we're launching a collection named worth of data to show what is the process right. This is govern like for governance. And here I can see buy with credit cards or buy with met with Metamask the implement auto Fenton so and you know the hardest part bro is the regulations. So we went to Finland Switzerland and financial authority not in North America. It's super complex, we invest raise the money like to make it respectable right and respecting material. So here as the as an investor as collector, I will use my email right. And I will say only my credit card, right? So make it here. And what happened at the end, I received an email giving me an access to a custodial with the complete informations and the NFC. NFT. Right. So I have all my data secured and if I want, if I want like send it to a noncustodial I can do it also. Okay. And this will make like a big difference in the market because we want it super easy as buying an Amazon right. So this is the collection I'm launching in a couple of months with the free freemium version. I'll probably AirDrop some of them for free for people I would love and I will be honored to have them as Ambassador like you if course if you're interested. And and yeah, man. So each piece of each each piece of non fungible certificate gives you voting access VIP to the private collection. The networking, all the other privileges is there is only 115 total. I'm
so amazing. Yeah, for sure. No def comment anywhere I can help anywhere I can. Absolutely right. Thank you. So, when if I put in the instance of a of an IP when I go to purchase this, is there a contractual agreement that I as a as an investor have to sign or I'm open to sign?
Yes, we complete that agreement with with our lawyers. So we checking we are checking with with financial authorities if we can keep the contract general. Like you, you read the contract and you you digitally signed you said okay I approve that as a condition. I will respect the licensing tutor, a tutor or we have to integrate all your data which is really sensitive. You have a lot of user a lot of lecture and investor from our tribe. They said you know I'm not comfortable on the blockchain. optimist. I want your private sheet guys I said I totally understand you are in 2024 You know, you cannot use the nickname and contract or NFT as a profile for now if we want if we want build trust exclusively where when major are bombarding us so we need to make it totally different. You know, the second level of evolution like three separate can set right people say oh no scary it's a scam. But before giving two 3/3 level where people will say there is evidence to push more.

Thank you so much. So this is the two updates so I'm super happy to show you. So this is nothing is public. You know I'm I'm honored to show you that. So the first thing not here so we turn the app 100% free to support creativity with a good audio, because you know, scientists are programmers, okay? They are techie but web three still minority. Let's be honest. This is the new platform. I'm turning a crowdfunding campaign with lavish. Okay, now which social is crowdfunding platform, nonprofit, supported by Dr. Dan. So 100% Free giving 100 free certificates make them you know, interact with that to add, like to add the IP right, what they have, like a scientific formula text or source code or whatever. And this will be launched as soon as I have the approval from from nourish, and this is BAP canto. So let's say for example, how to re parent my scientific study. Right. So what happened is we use GPT but we are we are protecting the data we use GPT Ali to re integrate the informations baked in free level of understanding. So here he gave you the process with five step right. We are switching to open source one because I hate I'm anti gas that like so, the SQ like you can book a meeting with a lawyer, a lawyer. We are pre negotiating now with Canada, US Switzerland and North Africa, packages for IP because abusive consultations and you can ask whatever What's your IP knowledge, let's say I'm a beginner. So based on that he prepared and customized the data for you and He gave you like some summary to educative one we are preparing video for that to make it more fast. What is your target protection monetization organization? So I want to organize my data. Then he goes through different steps like patentable, patentable invention, trademark copyright trade secrets, or trade secret because they're not spent any any any penny digital physical buff, you see. So he goes to follow the funnel. And the second version we wanted was vocal right with voice as you know, because people are lazy man. Yeah. If you want us copyright, so he asked you about KYC Of course, and you submit the form, you know the title. Let's say for example, research, beta, the type right I need one only one to raise money from it because it is used from funding to help searcher raise money faster without going through conventional process. So let's say I'm in the environment, the description literature so we go through the complete process at the end you have your certificate, listed your certificate convention contract and PDF with your name like Julian is the owner of this research. And let's say you decide to tokenize 20% of your IP to raise money for completing your developing your MVP or completing your research and development. So there is no ROI guarantee. And the investor is here supporting you. And if you make profit, of course, you're going to have some right so that's it. So that's what you get so far. It's crazy work, brother it's crazy work but I'm pretty confident like we're on the right track. Now this
is fire this is I like this a lot. I like this a lot we're so this files are this against I guess begins the pre process of filing the patent itself.
Yes.
Okay, and So walk me through So walk me through the tokenize like the crowdsourcing tokenization piece. So you you spin up the I guess the pre filing of the patent within the platform, there's an ability to dis design because it just gets tokenized. Right, exactly. And then you can devise or I guess compartments or whatever design a certain amount that is then going to crowdsourcing so where does that go? Like how does the how does the crowdsourcing happen? Once you've created these fractions of these fractals,

going guys. I forgot my phone in the car I'm going back to the to my desk. How's everything? Good man Busy, but good. How are you? Pretty good pretty good man. Everything is evolving fast.
Yeah,
busy to okay please go to my desk to be comfortable sorry for the minutes late you know always running and grinding Ronnie How was your daughter and your your your wife?
Still good? They're good. Yeah. Was it going well yourself? How's the family?
Yes, man. I'm pretty, pretty grateful that we come back to
Oh, buddy. Yes. So yeah. I would like to share with you some updates. I follow you saw like all the activity and the effort are doing so far. Congratulations. Thank you. A lot of a lot of work. And after your advice I connected with this the NFT disability or NFC NFC. I forget the name again. Yes. So I explore it had a good long talk with him. Super cool. He shared with me the challenge with adoption for scientist. So I try I try his app honestly, working really well. I tried to find a way how to implement this NFT to our protocol. So now to give you an update so far. I think you saw some some posts about that. We are implementing the technology with radix Impala NFT marketplace. Okay. Super cool cars super ecologic, and we're able to integrate the royalties for the for the Creator. Second part, pushing with ICP internet computer protocol. So now we're developing a brand new protocol in VIP 720 1x integrating the licensing and real royalties, right real IP we wanted like a strong protocol for that. And seven month we have a POC ready for AI. It's aI lawyer consultation about IBM. Yeah, because it can't talk. Yes. Yeah, I'm happy you found thank you so much for your support. So because a lot of user you know, different backgrounds like scientists programmers, also creative people they said you know, students too complex, how I describe my IP. Okay, I'm editing research to resolve for example, DP started to I don't know, what kind of problem in hospital How can describe that to be sure like my IP is well described and you know, respecting all the words so we may train them proof of data, the AI in US corporate and now we're able to do it for different jurisdiction. Okay. And, you know, the idea is, you talked with it, you talked with it for now, and it's catalogue your IP and I'll be able to show a small demo by that man How about you Sorry, I didn't ask you.
We know I've been busy. I've been traveling. I just got back from Australia.
Wow.
I'm going to be going to the UK. All throughout Asia for about a month and a half towards the end of the year. Towards the closer to the end of the year. Yeah, just a lot of traveling and networking and client visiting and all that kind of stuff.
I imagine a lot of work. It's a lot of fun. We got all my support. If I can help you with anything. You can count on me with pleasure. For sure. For
sure, definitely. This IP. This IP framework is going to be is going to be interesting because a lot of science doesn't operate. Ironically, a lot of science does not operate via IP in the same way but I think this opens up ways for it to operate via IP better. So as we get our or as I see, as people come to me with things that are relevant, I'll definitely for them your way, but as we also build out our own technical infrastructure. I mean, I think I mentioned this before, we want to just plug into as many as many features existing features. Out there as possible just kind of funnel people towards these things as they devise things that are related. So you're always high up on my list. Yes, yeah.

Desciworld development session Report 25/04/2024


Updates:

Locastic:

progress on the project form , temporary upload service built using supabase storage api

working on gallery upload field and video embeds

Solidant:

progress on scoping mostly on the scoring and distribution system , mickey has started to nail down what we need and beginning to think how to build there were several discussions around the topic arriving to the same consensus we had on last sync where we would build a distribution system that incentivizes RC vs ndividual 

nerdDAO:

exposed pain points on coordination and usage of PoC frameworks by the team , had a long discussion about what are the painpoints and what feedback and in what form is beneficial in order to improve the value from the current Brain implementation in the Desciworld telegram 

Internal: 

progress on the vector store backend project , hackathon project has been migrated 

most likely next project to be migrated will be the frame/tribe one , need to start looking into it 

Eneko came up with the idea of Bionic Reading as a potential good compression strategy  created a GitHub repository  for the code where he tested the idea of using bionic reading to compress engrams. I got a cosine similarity score of 92% on a simple test without optimizing the prompts. 

Found 2 good dataset candidates for LLM test data MedQA-USMLE & CommonsenseQA



Action Items:

continue migrating relevant POCs

still pending to look into the mystd deployment issue 

provide regular feedback for the telegram bot and encourage others to do the same
