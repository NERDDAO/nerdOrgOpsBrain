the UX stuff that needs to be fixed. We're going to use the Nerddex for our Pan-Asia hackathon, right? That's going to be our core product for that and we're going to make sure that that's like it's like tip-top UX and stuff.

When I'm saying this is going to happen, I'm not tasking anybody in particular in this chat with anything, right?

I'm just saying these are the things that we need to do. Let's start laying our hats on things and Demo now laid his hat on an interface for the research collectors and Echo is doing some things with changing the model, analyzing the model data and such.

Yet we're getting more interns in. I'm trying to recruit more interns for you Carlos. It's all happening. I understand you've got some frustrations.

I'm glad you feel comfortable to air them. I just feel like the problems are kind of in the process of being solved and the troll box on the Telegram channel was a necessary step for us to understand exactly what we want and how to interact with it.

We did not do what we needed internally, especially on the BD side. Maybe we're not at IDIN, but now we can fix it for the next couple weeks.

that we have to be testative.

Hold on to that and add more rules as we go on until we find a game that just works And the problem thing is that we desperately need to have that very clear in order to on board 100,000 people because we Haven't been able to onboard 20 people Because if we're talking about large scale coherent states like we talked to people with Mexico and Denver a lot of places and we haven't been able to Increase the scope of our coherence Like in any significant amount like we have some inklings like the the narrative thing was great because it wasn't like a desperate thing And it came with some interesting results But we need to As a research team we need to find the things that work Understand why they did and productize them over time and like our role is is a discovery But we need more parts of team Yes, I I think the main problem

Eneko Uruñuela
From as it is right now is that most people in the team are not comfortable or do not know how to use GitHub and how to use the brain that we have at the moment.

So I think we definitely like if that is a problem, we maybe have to come up with a solution for everyone to use internally.

I said if we are going to have a an interface for research for like it soon, we could just have our own.

Joshua Bate
Yeah, I would love to just have our own private interface where it's like our we can even have a separate ontology where we just have our decide what ontology because we it's our .

We can just make it everybody else.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Science was finished in February and like that build like just could use like a like a number of things.

And but again, do we have to make the design world interface for you guys to use. or is it something that needs to come from the internal depth team?

Joshua Bate
So Carlos Dima is making the interface for the research collectors, think I mentioned that to you recently, in the sense that it's going to be a simple interface with some clickable buttons for preset ontologies, it will pop up, you click this one, it will come up in the main field, you can fill it out, you can click submit.

Then it will be part of that vault. Then with the main build from Solidon, that will be attested to on-chain.

That's as simple as it needs to be for this first one. We can have our NDSY one internal one and just ask to have like the ontologies on the back end, a local one with the ontologies on the back end different just for us, just for internal production.

Then it can just be a web page that we can bookmark, have on our open tab where it's like daily updates or BD updates or some like that and we can start querying it.

the important thing is that it will be on all of our desktops and we can all then query it ourselves and make the reports ourselves and engage with it ourselves because it is fun when you have a vault on the obsidian and start

questions and it pulls this great like it's cool. But it's less cool reading a message from yourself in the channel.

I'm not even or two, I think it's I'm very, very glad that we have this system and it's exactly what we need.

I'm just saying that's probably why engagement is low. And so we can improve engagement between now and the end of May by just saying, okay guys, we'll all just learn the GitHub thing.

It's not that difficult. Everyone can do it. So starting by May 13, which is Monday, we all take a day every day to create the report and start just getting a little bit of exposure to what the reports look like and maybe give our own feedback.

It will engage ourselves much more. And we just do that every day between May 13 and the end of May.

And we'll have loads more feedback and it will be exactly everything that you wanted, but just very much later.

And your point about nerd decks, the science.tech stuff, it's been really great for many workshops. done a bunch of workshops with it and it works amazingly even live on stage.

It's awesome. I love showing people that I show live on demos. It's not like a full end user product right now like this.

And so the idea that you had, which is that every day somebody should produce the report, like it's their duty today's Monday, it's my time to produce a report, which means I have to go to GitHub, pull the GitHub repo that we've all been contributing to and inquiry it and then set shed.

in a group chat. That's a fantastic idea. And it's something I want to basically push. Unfortunately, Luis and Kali are not here, but I'm going to write a little thing over the next couple of days, hopefully by Monday, and send it out to the team.

it's like, okay, guys, let's keep contributing to the troll box. And this is the process to pull it. And Monday is mine, Tuesday is Jelani, Wednesday is whomever, right?

And we basically are the ones to pull it on that day, get all the data from the troll box, write the report or query for the report for the experience of getting a report and seeing what the AI actually does with this information and how it looks and that kind of stuff.

And I think it's a wonderful suggestion.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
And I think that's what we're going to do.

Joshua Bate
It just hasn't happened this week because there's been a lot of things going on. But by Monday, I'm hoping to have a little doc that I can send into the group chat.

We can all just read it and just action on it. Get GitHub desktop, click this button, do this thing, then you have it on your file, go to smart connections.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Because the thing is like, and I appreciate that. But also, I want you to sort of share my attitude towards these things where

I understand this is not like high-quality Apple-level user experience, right? And I also have the same gripes, like every extra click you have to do is something that I am consistently thinking of how to optimize, right?

But in order to do that, we need to sort of like put a pin on that and have more training data, because like we can solve a lot of these problems, but we need to prioritize where it's like, okay, is the problem the fact that it's in GitHub?

Then can we putting email you the embeddings or like making it into a query? There's a lot of things that we can do.

Joshua Bate
don't need to optimize for Trollbox on DCI World's internal chat if we're building a solution that's in a single UX that people can use.

Like we're not going to be providing people with research collective with the Trollbox on the Telegram channel. We're going to give them a separate UX that they can go and click the specific one.

Right.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
We started and we didn't go quick enough on the things we needed.

Joshua Bate
And that's not you. That's mostly on my mind. I haven't contributed enough with it. I also do not I do understand the github stuff I do understand that I'm just not like I'm just not into it It's just my brain as soon as I hear how you gotta go pull from github I'm just like, okay, I'll do something else right and that's that's my problem And it's because we haven't sat down as a team and spoken about how easy it is and we haven't had this discussion About how you don't want to be the one to query the vote all the time We spoken about it and that got I briefly but we didn't come to a solution.

This is a great solution We'll do the github. We don't need to optimize away from the github clicks for this particular process internally to get the training data Because it's not gonna happen when the research collectors go live themselves They're not gonna have to do this.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
So we don't need to over engineer this thing internally Just we can just use the github stuff and it's not that difficult Yeah, it was worth we could I can push a sip to tell you which of that the all I'm saying is like it's about finding like a it's like Inventing soccer right like at first like you try a bunch of things and then you put two goals on each side and it works It's like, okay, let's let's let's

And so I agree what you're saying and I know and that's why I said earlier I would really love to give you the space and freedom to keep continuing on the work that you're doing because that's where your expertise is and that's where so much as I mentioned to you before ATOX that the that's where so much of the growth is going to come especially after the token launch is in these really novel exciting productized interfaces.

The research collectives are so simple and they're not that great for product but most of the people who are going to use this don't know what products are out there they don't know how sick AI is they don't how easy

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Yeah, but like, what I'm saying is, you can have like a letter from the president of the United States saying that you have to use blue sky, right, because he likes blue sky and he's been done the , like, you have to use my son for research on me.

It's corporate law, right? If that comes from the top down, they could agree with it, but they're going to have like exactly the same sort of curve that we're seeing here where it's like spike, and then no one uses it.

And then you come back six months later and he's like, Oh, what about that thing? Oh, no one uses it.

And that's, listen, listen, I am not. This is not an either or situation. I don't understand what you're trying to say is like, we know that the research collectives are ready to go.

Joshua Bate
They're very simple infrastructure and there's people that want to use them. So let's just do that.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
And let's understand all the other stuff or the additional exciting use cases.

Joshua Bate
Let's keep building those two. The research collectives are the biggest lift of that is getting this initial stage of having the troll box where it's like a deployable little UX.

And then the other biggest lift is getting people to use it. we've been doing that. The bd side have been doing that and we've got

Collections of people who pre-written white papers about what they're going to do with the thing and they can't wait to use it And so that's like it's not a problem at all I think that the important thing to consider is I want your opinion and your advice on the best way to iterate on those research Collectives themselves like what what is it about that interface that you think would be most valuable to keep it most coherent?

So that's actually usable that sort of thing is really is really important That's fine.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Like I don't know what sort of advice you want them because what I'm trying to say is Like that's okay that we have the intent, but if like my main my main like argument for this is that If we were in a situation where every day where everyone is is making their own report on the troll books that we have It's like people are fighting over who's gonna be the next one making it We had an elitics and like a leaderboard about who's who gets into the next report And we're all having so much fun about it that we couldn't stop telling people about it.

I would 100% agree with you in saying like, okay, let's try to get as many people as possible because this is going to be so much fun, right?

But as it currently stands, if you give me like a group of 500 people that's a huge organization, they want to use our thing explicitly for their organization's need throughout the thing, we're going to do a very much showing because like I really don't think that at this stage that system is going to do that because it hasn't done that for ourselves.

Joshua Bate
I don't have any any big problem is with with our troll box is that it's on Obsidian Vault, which is hosted on your web on your computer.

That's the biggest problem, right? lot of us aren't really familiar with it. We haven't been spoken about it internally.

What's your thoughts on it? That's the sort of we need, right? you, Atox Carlos, All right, guys, I want to see some data analysis.

Enneco, would you be interested in pulling some insights on this data? All that kind of , right? Do the conversations out in the open in the dev chat.

It's great. We can all be very excited to see everybody collaborating happily, right? That's what we want. I have to go.

know Raquel does, and I know Enneco does.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Much love, everybody.

Joshua Bate
Thank you so much. Let's keep it going.

**Forwarded from [Eneko Uruñuela](https://t.me/eurunuela)**

The important thing I think is that you've got to meet the people where their interests are at and as you've been saying this yourself, but analyzing data to find insights is not something that I've ever wanted to do.

It's not like I don't know how to, I don't really want to, I don't know how to access the data, don't know where to store it.

So what I'm saying is that we have to delegate these to the people that want to do it. Enneco would be the man for this, unfortunately he is otherwise occupied in June, so maybe in May this is something that you and Enneco can talk about if Enneco has a space for it to actually analyse some of the data that we have.

Dima is otherwise occupied with the interface, that's fine. When that's done, if it's done in this time, we can start analysing data also.

Do we need a data scientist? That's something that I always ask why I always look at the data. Enneco, I would love for you and ATOX to get on a call, speak the Spanish up and figure out exactly what it is that you guys want to analyse and get some cool reports from and give Carlos the information that he wants to see written up.

Carlos, also, I would love to see Ricardo, for example, if he wants to become an intern and take his token allocation, for example, would love to be interested in providing him some of that.

He's a data scientist if he wants to be involved and draw insights, get in a team. But it's just the problem with the cash flow, that's the problem right now.

Otherwise we can find more data scientists. These are people like I see I hear we go I hear your point and I hear that you just you think it's a very simple thing You want the insights?

I'm just never gonna do it. I'm just I don't I want you to ask the question I want you to do the answering.

I want you to Want to know who's the guy who has the most knowledge points right now and be able to tell I have I have a real Problem is is that all the data we have has been gathered from disparate sources put really pretty unstructured in some ways over the last four months if we What like it it's too much for me to even think about like or where the sources of information like I don't like who has the most knowledge points Honestly, I I don't even think I'm gonna have any idea who the person is because No, it's so it's definitely there is someone because It's not that interesting data for me right now because it's been test data for the last four months If we wiped it clean say in May May 31st when we start the research collectors that would be really interesting Well, that's the thing like the whole point of this

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
is that since we've been capturing a whole bunch of disparate data if we get a strong signal here it means we're on to something.

I know we're going to end up with a very structured optimized thing but if this works here and the the most interesting bit of data is actually the one we think oh this is actually the most interesting thing like that is something that we can that we can use as a solid signal to say okay we are on to something.

Joshua Bate
Yeah I agree and if I can help I can help I don't think I can I'd love to if you need me to help facilitate the conversations with the right people let me know otherwise over to you to do the communication if you do it openly in the dev chat as well rather than DMs that's better in my opinion because then we can all participate in the conversation and like guys don't be no one be afraid of each other right we're all working towards the same thing so I'm not saying anyone is but I'm just saying I want everybody to just say hey I have a this idea okay I'm just like Dima for example you'd call us you have an idea about

filtering on the queries. That's a great idea. You want to explore it. You know you should ask Carlos Atox about this, right?

He's the man to talk about this because he has the knowledge of it. So in the dev chat, hey, Atox, I have this thought.

if it's some things that we're not like, if it's far cast, then we're just not interested or. later and have much enthusiasm about don't get disheartened, we'll find people that have that other products that you want to build like the games we'll all test them out anything like that I think is trial and error absolutely and with the trial box at trial and error also but I feel like we've got you know the trial and the error and now we've got the result which is like not perfect and we've got more work to do but it's what we want.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Yeah like and the thing is like it is a permanent cycle where like that version of the troll books for example right now it has a change where it's like people started adding a lot of things now everyone has their own folder but now someone has to make the reports a bit of a harder report so maybe we have to do a cannoli now this is troll books version 0.2 and then we like that logic like because like it's logic that we're going to end up turning into code because at the end is data in data out and like the thing about obsidian is that it lets you sort of like trial things by hand where it's you're setting up the actual full there is

Eneko Uruñuela
and the actual things and you can edit them but once we figure it out that becomes like pipes on a call and then that's something you interface standalone and then that becomes your interface but again it's all this constant process of okay it didn't work it worked let's see why let's continue and let's just go for an echo because his hand must be hurting yeah i'm glad my i'm not actually raising my mind that'd be the last comment from me and then i'm gonna hang up i completely agree with you Carlos and i think i do i have noticed why people may not have any use then i think it's just the interface wasn't clear enough for everyone in the team but i think that's why it's more important than ever to have a few research collectives

are using our interfaces or maybe they will provide us with not just data but different ways of using proof of knowledge and so we will be able to ideally in my opinion we should do like at the beginning like weekly meetups with them and ask you know what did you like what did you like what do you find frustrating whatever and then go back to the data try to see if there's any correlation and work not to improve the system right so all this is say if we have a DC world interface for the team to use a system and there are also research collectives who have a different interface or it could be the same one I think the usage will increase especially within the team I because I then I could see Carolina

instance using it every day. mean I could definitely see that. But yeah, all this to say I think we're going to have all this data soon and we'll be able to iterate more on different versions of the system.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Let me just like resist against that a little bit because first right now we have three live interface. We have the parkaster interface.

We have the science of type interface and all the stuff is in a different embedding set and we have all the information from the past stuff.

The thing is that we already have a lot of data that we haven't analyzed properly and yeah we have like we have if if someone asks ask me let me know what are all the interfaces I can go and ask a question to

I can do it. And what I want is for us to sort of try to make this into a feedback loop where it's like we have information coming from several places and we are being more productive.

Like we should be able to notice the productivity increase and honestly I'm not feeling it yet. But I'm looking for it and I just want you guys to actively be looking for the same thing.

And when we don't find it, do the question like why? Why are we not finding the thing?

Joshua Bate
It's also important and I get anyone for free to leave if you need to leave. I need to leave ASAP as well.

**Forwarded from [Eneko Uruñuela](https://t.me/eurunuela)**

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Yeah, and also, understand that all of these things are just, like, for example, like, even if we don't, the fact that we didn't use it is a test result that is good for us to understand, because that means that we have to keep working on, like, different things at point.

And like, that's the whole thing. I don't keep bringing it up, and I don't keep getting the feedback, I can iterate on this idea.

And like, a good example of that is, for example, the, sorry, I don't know, are you right over here?

Just a second. The librarian role is something, okay, it occurred to me, trial did it, socialized it, but it didn't really go, like, it hasn't gone anywhere.

And I think that this idea of rotating the librarian role is a good, like, attempt of trying something else.

And like, that will help enable, like, some feedback loops. as you hand over the role, you set your own schema and someone else can use your schema and then you can keep going.

But that literally is our development processing, okay, trying out an idea, trying to see if it sticks. then, because for example, the knowledge anger media definitely sticks, right?

Everyone was like, okay, get it, a unit of knowledge, knowledge graphs, let's go around that. And we, now that's in turn, that's a part of our internal lore, And whenever I come up with something, you're like, oh, you didn't tell us, and I'm literally telling you in that moment, and you're like, resistant to the fact that I'm telling you, like, that's good, because like, now that exists, and like, the outcome of that, like, resistance, whether it stays or is, like, defeated, like, if you, like, let it in and make it part of your speech, and what you're saying, that means that that can be established as part of our internal lore.

And like, I just want you guys to like be actively participating in this process where it's like it's okay we're not using it but we need to actively be thinking why right and it's like okay like like we tried out the troll box nobody used it Carlos is not mad because nobody used it is mad Carlos is like mad because nobody cares about why right nobody is like the fact that nobody used it and nobody cares that's what is like dude i mean we all like i'm not saying i'm just trying to i'm just trying to train a response where it's like okay i'm trying something it worked it didn't work why didn't work where can it be improved okay we'll go back to the drawing board look at me take try new things the next time we find something that is interesting we'll try all the out see if it works and that loop is what is going to bring us to the thing that where we can invite more people in and say okay we have this going like we're going to go to this place and we're going to sit side to side and and our hackathon team is going to put

or are they more than your hackathon team? Yeah. And like, like.

Joshua Bate
So I think the Nerddex is a winner and we know that, right?

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
And that's great. And so what I, a neck, I'm sorry, last point.

Joshua Bate
What I want to suggest is like, I feel like your iterations on the Trollbox have got us to this point where we know what we want from the research collective interface, right?

Like in this main version, right? Because of the work that you've been doing with this and the reports it's I would have no idea how to structure this in my mind had I not seen what you've been doing.

The problem, of course, was the fact that we didn't all have the vault query, but with this, we do have the vault query with the research collective interface.

And that's wonderful. So I think, like I said, we'll do the Trollbox in the meantime. So we have more data for the end of the month.

But I think as it stands conceptually, it's enough. What I think the failure process is most exciting about is the interfaces, the general excess of interfaces that we can build.

That's where I want to see as much trial and error as possible. And I fully support that as much as possible.

But yeah, I think maybe dashboarding data is a really great idea for sure. Just at the very least, what are still users internal auditing and to show potential users, potential investors, potential token buyers, look at all this dope data we've got and all these analytics.

It could even be a June dashboard, which is super easy to do. Yeah, because the main thing is the database is there.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
It's really easy to interface. the database and do different queries and like the thing is that I don't like like having to play all the roles because I end up not being motivated to keep going and like if I had people saying okay here's the reports for what you did and then I can react to that but I'm in a situation where I have to do both sides and it's like I'm just venting in the sense that like the for example the the troll box tool right like out of the top of my head I could I could tell you it's being like a like a downward slope in in engagement and that's part because I'm the only one doing reporting and like the thing is on github and like anyone could have said the same thing on their end but I have to like if if I want you guys to interact with that I have to like micromanage that and then go make the other interface

is that we will want to have their own. I'm not saying, again, this is not me complaining or saying I'm unhappy with the situation of things, but I think it be way more productive if we had some sort of feedback mechanism where I can make decisions based on feedback that I get from you guys.

And we can set it up so it's fairly automated in the sense that all the pipelines, once you set the dashboard, it's just about refreshing the thing.

And we can even make it into like a button that makes you the report. again, if I feel like I'm the only one recording the data, making the reports and then reading the reports and caring about what's in them, I'm not caring.

Joshua Bate
So there's two things. Firstly, the research collectives in the May iteration by the May iteration should be a basically troll box that can be queried and results can be produced.

So we'll have like five of six preset ontologies that you can use because we want to keep it coherent as possible and then maybe one or two preset reports that we say like click this button and produce a weekly report and we just basically preloaded a query at the end that they could do.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
mean I'm just well before you go on I'm just worried like the thing I'm worried the most is that there's a lot of protocols that have like for example like the more singularity people like actually I don't like guys they made like a hell a lot of buckets like buckets upon buckets inside buckets of buckets for this and for that buckets buckets buckets right like if you make a bunch of like on-chain things that doesn't just guarantee people are going to use them like we could make research collectives and super research collectives and committees and like like setups and everything but if we don't have people to engage with those things like to really care and like freaking go to war or the thing so

Joshua Bate
I will stop you because first of you missed the beginning of the call where Luis was telling us about some of the work that he's been doing with like some really high-quality people like the senator of Mexico and UNESCO people and who are literally have said we want to create a research collective they're going to send an LOI for it.

We have on our side Jelani, myself, Carolina and I don't know who else have got about a dozen at least serious groups together who are ready whenever we have it to do basically a troll box.

It's not something that you can it's like being alive You can like sell that to people you can offer like things that foster that or things that like don't right now we as a Group of humans needs need to figure out what what's our product?

like going from freaking like coordination coherence states to like what's the actual thing we're actually making people do we need to have like a list like Okay, you come here and you play this game and then you rank up and it's a physics game So you're you're doing physics stuff and then you have this weekly report and these are like dynamics that we're sort of like Trying to pull out of this thing where it's like, okay, what if instead of papers you have weekly reports?

like if we make this thing like report on a subject every 15 minutes Right, and it will create the latest report of physics That it knows and you know that it's going there's gonna be a reporting 50 minutes So like you want to add information before that Again, this could be a game that helps us tell research collectives like okay You're working with us make this game so that people on a 15 minute basis are getting a report

Joshua Bate
like latest and various report or anyone can query the report like but those are the things that are end up being the product right okay look i mean the the idea of creating products out of the research like out of the embedding set is like one of the end to the power of n things that we can do with this right which is really exciting and that's what i'm hoping the interns are going to help with is just bringing fun ideas and cool things like that there's a guy i mentioned to Carlos earlier there's a guy who we're potentially going to bring in he's very interested as an intern so with nerd basically and he's built something which is like a super super lightweight like ultra lightweight piece of code where it's like a gather where you walk around and you can see other people in multiplayer sense like online but then you have some kind of like tree attached to your character which is just a pixel and that tree contains some information about things that you care about

Now, I suggested that we could do the same thing, but with a wallet connect, and so your character is your wallet, and then so when you walk past someone, you can see what they're working on or what they've been working on as a HTML file that comes out, and you can just like instantly click on their thing and it tells you this is what they've been doing.

And we could have that because it's so lightweight, as like a button in the research collective, which is like, you know, walk around or something, and you just click it and it quickly goes up to this very lightweight piece of code where you just a pixel, you walk around, you see other people who are in the research collective, you see what they're doing.

These are called a fun thing, right? And so these interfaces are, as I said, end to the power of end, right?

And that's great. And I think, like I'll be honest, Carlos, I would much be very happy to just like support you to just keep doing the thing of finding novel use cases for the interfaces, far caster games, working with the interns, helping them get aligned and building some cool things, and just keep shipping dope that uses POK as the back end, because as you mentioned, it produces a lot of data.

We can use it for future. for the build and such, and then maybe I'm thinking on the internal side, Carlos Demo and Aneko, maybe you guys could think about working on the data analysis and analytics and maybe like dashboarding the data and figuring out like what kind of terms are used, I don't know, Aneko, maybe you could focus, I know next month you're very busy on your Aneko, yeah, you are very busy next month.

Okay, anyways, maybe you could set yourself a small task if you have free time to like find a way to track hallucinations or something and like have some data on that if you have time for that, not sure what sort of time you will have.

Joshua Bate
already data we've retrieved but we haven't reported on at all and we had a conversation about this and I think that like we should start there if we have extra time yep okay yeah I I think we're all aware of some miscommunications primarily to do with me I think between the ideas of nerd and DCI world and how these things interact in terms of work share work required like work expectations and stuff I think we've had these conversations and I'm glad that we've had them it's necessary and the fact that they happen in the way they did it is what it is we're all bigger than that so let's just communicate openly using the dev channel communicate openly using the dev chat to figure out what it is that we want if you have any questions and you're not sure where to start and communicate with each other please and that's for all of us right now

I'm not throwing shade at all. I know, I'm always trying to be productive.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
And here, I think that we should refocus, because especially now that we started off the VC angle, we were all assuming, OK, VC is going to love this, if they throw a bunch of money.

Because that was our initial plan last year. Remember, we had the conversation where it's like, OK, we're going to do the narrative house.

The narrative house is going to let you talk to all these people, and they'll probably be interested. We around, found out.

Cool. Now, we are pivoting, but in order to do that, we also have to set ourselves some goals. Much like we also talked about, OK, our goal is maximizing for coherence.

Like a long time ago, it's like, what's true, what's not. I told you guys, OK, let's make sure it's coherent first.

Any movement can make it. Go here, then a lot of things can happen.

Joshua Bate
Yep.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Uh, in that sense, um, like just as an update or current thing is I'm working on this like mod framework, uh, like I had done a bit of this last year, but it's like on chain storage, like you can define, basically you can put, it's like a way for you to make your ontology into smart contract, which is cool.

Like it's like a more nuanced of the station thing, like, which I'm using for the game, like that I'm trying to build, show you stuff about it.

But the truth of the matter is that if you look at code, it's all, all code is CMS code with extra steps.

It's all like management of entities and relationships and like that. Um, and that means that if we can make it run coherently on this game stage, like.

We can ship it to our research collective, for example, and if you like the same dynamic Okay, you won the game with so they defeat the dragon right now Let's just move it over to physics.

You won the game of like figuring out why Warmholes exist whatever and we use the same Metrics because we're using the same lists to keep the ranking and the relationship structure.

Yeah. Yeah now We still are focusing on finding ways to achieve large-scale coherent states. That's like our Thing right?

That's our like main if you if you ask people like If you what do you do? Oh, I'm trying to figure out how to make large-scale coherent states.

That's the one liner And I do use that.

Joshua Bate
I do use that a lot. That's cool. That's what it's now.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Now the point is how And we need to figure out what's working and that's like One part of it or it's like, okay, we need to look at our previous and I you're making fun of the guys can read too I know English but anyways We we need you to read this things and We need to create a thing that we can offer research like what what are we offering research collectives?

Like that question should be very clear and like if you tell me Carlos What are you offering research college with large-scale coherent states like what like what is that like coordination?

That is like I'm offering you financial freedom like that is Coordination is a state is a state that you achieve.

Joshua Bate
Right, yes, absolutely. I wonder if we can do any work there about, for example. optimizing the ontologies and then making it so that the communication between the intra-research collective torque is less, like hallucinase less.

Atox, don't know if you have any thoughts about how you could utilize the May build which would be retrieval and hyperlinking through the ceramic and indexes.

I don't know if you have any thoughts about how you could utilize that in June for the interfaces that you're building, any of the interesting interfaces you're building?

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Yeah, I mean, that build needs to be finished. It was never finished. Which build? The May build. It was never finished.

Joshua Bate
No, I'm talking about the May build that Soledad will finish by the end of May.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
What did you think I was talking about?

Joshua Bate
the science thing?

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
No.

Joshua Bate
So they'll have the retrieval with the ceramic and index from that work I think that's what we'll do.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
I mean that does basically exactly the same thing that our thing does right now so other than being on ceramic which is cool.

Joshua Bate
Like that's the foundation though right that's the foundation of all we'll come so I know it's nothing novel but if it's on ceramic I don't know how much of a change that is I don't technically know what kind of change it is like to make it so that this all integrates well I don't know if it provides any material improvements over what we already have either but just saying that that's the state it will be and like what if that helps or hinders in June.

Carlos A. Vera (At0x.eth)
Yeah I mean like our things that we are integrating as new things come in we just put them in the build and fit them where it makes sense so whatever either of the teams working on

this provides, much like what Carlos did, his contribution to the build with the tracking is really good. And like, for example, on top of that, you can build a dashboard, Nalytics, we could already know who has the most valuable input.

We could like get a lot of interesting insights for design from that data. I think that if we have extra time before going even forward, should spend some energy in looking at what we, sort of like the trap, we set some traps out in the wild, right?

And if you just let the prey rod in the trap, it's worth nothing. So we set out some things, some metrics and some Nalytics that are being like stored on Mongo.

And like, I've been paying a lot of money for Mongo too. Yep, like last month was $300 this month was a hundred something Okay, just so that you trackable that by the way I have a big list of things I need to invoice because I haven't done any of that But more to the point That is there and all the bills have the link to access it and I can give you guys like extra access if you need extra queries But that would be very helpful in in saying oh look at this like warm box keeps break getting queried and like We could work with them and have them keep keep updating things and like Maybe think about and other kind of things right and maybe do reporting like live reporting Like make it a competition like make a web page in like in DCI world web page You could have the leaderboard of which ideas have been queried and all that is

Carlos Di Matteo
Other than like so basically we're going to have what we have right now but on ceramic index network and I believe what we should work and we said this in the in the death call is basically MVPing the research collective approach so like the the DAO stuff you're muted you're muted yeah I think so I've already messaged Dan and asked him what he feels about us developing things in this June period that they would want to develop or they've been scoped to develop how he feels about us taking that work from him he hasn't replied yet um we can talk to them tomorrow about it with this information that Dan's telling me but I'm thinking more

Joshua Bate
Like, I just don't know the depths of what it is that we're doing and what it is that we can build on top.

Great. Thank you, Luis. Appreciate your help, mate. Thanks for your hard work.

Luis Maumajean
good luck, mate.

Joshua Bate
So maybe Carlos and Carlos, you guys have a thought about this a bit more direction because Mickey said that maybe there's some things that you guys could add to it in that period of time.

I don't know what he was referring to and we're having this call tomorrow. He's just to let you know there's a call tomorrow with Nicky, which we could ask him, but maybe if we go informed with some answers for ourselves, that would be Don't start once.

Carlos Di Matteo
Why? That was a joke because no one had unmuted themselves. Yeah, no, like, I believe, like, we're basically going to have

similar version to what we have right now just like organized and in ceramic that's basically the difference that it's not gonna be MongoDB it's gonna be Chrome and then the whole streams thing but it like we're just going to be plugging in our things into this that's that's basically what we're gonna be doing on June and then technically if like unless some other work comes up I think the the next best thing is start to set up the Dow stuff okay I suppose well we could also focus a little bit on the setup with the infra I don't know how long this takes I don't know how much of a struggle the infras but hopefully by June we can gather hopefully by June we can gather 20k for the rig and start hooking that up which I don't know if that's something that we should do or solid it should do but again if you guys can offer some

Joshua Bate
insights there Yeah, that makes sense.

Carlos Di Matteo
So basically with the Apart so what mickey is going to build a part of it is obviously going to be hooking up in the LLM So it would really be on his side to hook the rig because it should be quote-unquote easy But yeah, if it makes sense like The only the thing about the rack is that the only reason why we haven't done it yet is because money Usage so if we think it makes sense then Like having the rack would be beneficial no matter the state we are because if we have it tomorrow We can plug it into an echo stuff if we have it next month Then we can plug it into the research collective stuff and then it goes stuff So it's like whenever it comes its beneficial

So if you want and can do that on June, then fine. Yeah, that's that's a good target for me to say June.

Joshua Bate
Well, let's get it hopefully in June. OK, cool. What other things could we do in that period of time?

Yeah, we could design the research collective interfaces.

Eneko Uruñuela
I was about to say that onboarding of research collectives should happen in June. Should happen.

Joshua Bate
That will be that the onboarding of research collectives will primarily be the DCI world like growth, lead, majorlining, heroin, et cetera, whoever else wants to join in on that.

course, it's a team effort. Feel free to refer us. But I'm thinking just development side more than anything. I want to go to the call tomorrow with Mickey and have some suggestions for him so that we don't, know.

Yeah, well, mean, well, I'm meant by that.

Eneko Uruñuela
It's having some interfaces for them. Oh, OK.

***

**Forwarded from [Eneko Uruñuela](https://t.me/eurunuela)**

We are going to be using interfaces and they're going to be cool, but my opinion personally is that after the token launch, especially for the first like six months up to the end of the year, the interfaces, which is the novel ways to interact with this database,

such as the games or the other such visualizers. That's gonna be a really big driver of growth because the token will be out and you'll be able to earn token rewards based on your end-ground creation and its usage.

And so DGENs who are very familiar with the on-chain environment are gonna be using this and they're be using it quick and hard and they're gonna be interested primarily in these interfaces I think.

What that does is that puts tokens in the hands of people because we're emitting these tokens and they're earning these points and they're getting excited.

So that when we launched the research collective on-chain infrastructure, it can actually go and spend it by creating research collectors.

And so we have a plethora of real scientists, real data, really useful, really useful like vaults before the launch and token that carry over after the launch and token and interfacing with that data becomes exciting, becomes monetizable.

And then we can basically use this as our launchpad to bring a bunch of interesting research collectors from the decentralized community and say, look, they've got this UN1, here's a great example of how it should be done, et cetera.

So that's a brief overview. of the upcoming couple of months with Soledent. Luis, free to leave at the hour.

Carlos and Carlos, reason I asked you both to be here is because this section here, which is this period of time where Soledent won't be working with us, we can do stuff.

And we should brainstorm in this call about what it is that we can do. Any questions on this at all by Carolina and Luis in particular?

OK. So this is in some ways frustrating because it's two months out of the next four that we're not going to be having Soledent on development work.

August can't be helped. June is my fault, ultimately, but it is what it is. And also fun, fun, fun side point.

The project that I designed for this other company, the token design for them, is quite close to the research collective in some ways, in many ways, actually.

It's a great system that's specific to theirs, but it resembles in some ways the research collective infrastructure, not the brain, but the sub-dowels and stuff like

this. So Mickey's going to go, Mickey's the guy on our account, he's going to go build this in June and then come back to us in July and have basically done most of the research and the experience of the building of the stuff that we need for the research collectives but through another company and get for another project and getting paid by them.

So for us this is really great because it gives us a bit of a head start on the research of research collectors in particular the governance infrastructure and such and also to be clear this come this project that he's building in June there research collectors which are not actually research collectors those will be built with a brain built in most likely like or at least later integrates and they'll have their own their own brain for it.

Okay so that's the that's the update on that. Any feedback? Cool all right so next thing is to determine Carlos and Carlos kind of over to you maybe what it is that we have or might

be able to do in the period of time where Nicky's not here. I'm happy to suggest some things but maybe you guys can start.

Um, why don't we give Mickey from June to Synapse DOW so he can go and complete that. And then we just take a break from DeciWorld.

And in that month, basically we just raise a bunch of money. this will, what this will do will give me more time to sort of say how much debt do I want to go into personally?

Because if we don't raise money from DeciWorld, I'm paying the money that we owe solid and right. So he's going to say like, he says, like, why don't we do June off?

So you have a bit more time to sort of understand your finances and make those decisions come to life if I want to continue taking on more debt.

And in this June period, the development team at DeciWorld, our team, will look at this build and basically add new things.

do it, like whatever we can implement from ourselves, like to improve the build in this meantime, then July comes around and they start again.

Just very briefly, for this, the token launch I'm anticipating is sort of end of August, right, around September time, end of August, September.

Now, in the lead up to that period of time, the research collectives before the token launch in particular are going to be our primary vehicle of growth, primary vehicle, because we can build the research collectives with these local interfaces, so it's like a small brain that in itself just works, you can query it like our obsidian ball, for example.

And that's enough for a lot of the researchers to have cool tools, like just fun to use and actually function on collaboratives.

By the end of May, Solident will have the ngram uploading and query system through the ceramic streams and the indexing.

So the full actual POK system without any points tracking and without the research collective on chain infrastructure and without the token, but the POK in a sense of

submitting an n-gram, having it on chain and then being able to query a chatbot and it to be referenced and retrievable.

That's going to be ready by the end of May. So what that means is that we can have research collectives that will local research collectives about, you know, this is the AI one, for example, and it can be a little brain just like our vaults on obsidian, which is cool, but by the end of May, this will also be able to talk to the global research collective brain vault so that this can be queried.

so you could ask it a question and the query will either return a research collective to then go in query or it can return the data itself from each of these research collectors.

This is going to be limited in scope because of the semantic compression, which will not be ready by the end of May.

So, for example, we will not be able to do random bits of data that all talk to each other.

It's going to have to be very structured. So for the research collectives in this first period, we're going to have preset structures or preset ontologies that these scientists or the users can submit.

So there'll be like maybe five, six, seven ontologies status up. day, claim, evidence, whatever. These particular ontologies that they can submit, they'll be fixed.

It's restrictive and not that great, sure, but it will allow us to have this coherent brain in this early stage, because if we start missing in lots of data, this is going to very quickly probably start hallucinating.

So this is for tests, this is for the early stage over the next month, that's what we'll have by the end of month.

Then in June, we just roll that out. Around here, we start getting the points tracking system done. The points tracking will allow us to, when you get your things queried, it will track the points and then it will build an on-chain Merkle tree so that you can verify the points.

Then the token will launch and then after the token will probably have the research collected DAO infrastructure built. Before the token launch, as I mentioned, research collectives are the primary vehicle for growth.

Joshua Bate
Yes, Carolina, is also important to remember is that Carolina has a lot of responsibilities that, for example, I do not have or I do not have.

Carolina, you are the one I want there a lot. I want everyone there for sure. Carolina, I really want you there.

I want you there with Brenda as well. I hope you can be there for longer than four days. I do not know what else to suggest.

I think if you can be there for longer than four days. It does not have to be more than four days at a time.

But I think if not going twice in that first month might be useful. I think you should be there for longer than four days because you will get there, will have a bit of fun, will get settled, you meet a few people and you will leave.

We should have a strong presence there. Okay, and Louise, about your comment about getting connections, yes, once we know a bit more, understanding who we know, that's useful, maybe making a few early outreaches is useful, but I wouldn't suggest that we go in and say, hey, can we get this Argentinian senator, for example, to assist with the legal stuff until we go there and we touch base.

We can go there and say, by the way, we know these people, and maybe we can help you with this and this.

And in protocol labs in Crescent Miento, you can say, okay, yeah, cool, let's talk about it, and then we can start introducing these contacts.

I don't think setting it up beforehand would be, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like setting up beforehand might be showing our hands early.

Cool. Any other questions or thoughts on Crescent Miento? It's in August, I've got documents that I'm going to send into the group chat now.

Okay, let's get us things in there. to check the chat. Okay, Carolina, cool. Also, I'm going to clear up the group chat.

There's too many ... Oh, think once there's a better schedule, it'll easier to say when and long. Okay, cool.

There's too many channels on this group chat, by the way, so I'm going to delete a bunch. I'll do it later.

Next thing is... All right, let's do the solid thing just now. Who doesn't know about the solid update? Raise your hand if you don't know about the solid update.

Okay, Does everybody else know about the solid update? Great. No. Okay, Carolina doesn't know also. Yeah, thought not. Okay, I'll very briefly explain it.

I had already explained it a couple of times, but I'll tell a few people. So forgive me if you're hearing this again for the second time, but it's going to be explained again.

Okay. This is a big update. So I spoke with Solident and my friends. I spoke with them about the fact that the

raised strategy that I opened this call with at this point with because my friends and they're giving us free not free they're giving us development in lieu of payment to begin with so we can get on the on the track towards the product before the payment comes in.

So it's fair that they know our funding situation. So they are they started in April which is here this is April right and it is now May which is here and this is the end of May.

They've been working with us since that. For June they are not going to work with us. For July they are going to work with us.

For August they are not going to work with us and onwards from August until we need to stop them they're going to work with us.

I'll explain why. In August, Mickey the guy who's on our account the lead on this particular thing he's a brilliant dev, he's having his second child so he's taking that month off congratulations then.

In June this is the thing that's important to know so I'm involved with another project I helped them with their tokenomics protocol design it's called Synapse Down.

to refer them to solid it just as a way to help Dan say it like his, uh, do you want to do this project?

They said they're going to scope it. scoped it. Then I told Dan about the funding situation and Dan says, Josh, Mickey is the person who's best to do Synapse DOW as account because it's right up his skill set.

I Love my crypto people.

Luis Maumajean
Yeah. No, actually It would be interesting in getting all the agenda because I could ask around and see if we have access to certain Keep people out down there.

Whether it's governments. It's media. It's a scientist is whatever I can ask around that remembering a couple of groups with Very high ranking people inside that might help us you who knows maybe we should get an answer of this Let's days from Gabriela and is she joins?

Maybe she can make a few calls down there as UNESCO and that would be As well as for Asia, right?

Vitalik has Zuzagu, his own network. Like, there's all these things that are happening on the network state side that's directly tying it to, which is directly tying it to the crypto movement, right?

The network state is being directly tied to the crypto movement these days because it's natural. Cresemiento is a network state to be set up in Argentina following Malay's positive remarks about crypto.

It's... Everyone's sort of saying it's a no-brainer. It's the moment where people can set up a crypto-native economy and political system in city in Argentina.

I agree with them. Whether or not I like Malay, I agree with them that this is the moment for that.

I've been saying I kind of likened it to Deng Xiaoping in China, sort of like when he came into power and opened up the economy, China grew massive.

So I think Argentina is going do the same. protocol labs who are a very powerful computing innovation project ecosystem, they are setting this up alongside many of these top Argentinian builders from Open Zeppelin, for example.

It's massive and it's in August. There's a month in August that it's the first month and then afterwards it's going to continue hopefully in their opinions forever, but the first month is like a big kickoff event.

I suggested to Carolina in particular, because she's in Uruguay. Carolina in particular that she should go and we should team up with Desai Latam, which is Brenda, who is Argentinian.

Team up with Brenda and basically go there and say, look. this network state is not about d-sci, but d-sci is a part of it.

We should be the leading voice in d-sci in this network state because the other network states are handling d-sci, but they're not doing it very professionally and they're certainly not doing it particularly ethically, in my opinion.

And so d-sci world can lead the charge on really powerful distributed ethical d-sci. On the same side, we are empowering scientists who are currently being disempowered by Malay in the public sphere as being gutted, and so we can actually use that as empower scientists to earn a fair share, even if the public system is failing.

So it's a no-brainer for us to be there. D-sci Latin is a great partnership that we have, so let's do this.

I suggested that I would go for the first month to help sort of grease the wheels a little bit and explain the product to certain people, and Catalina and whomever else would like to come, I invited both Carlos and Carlos and Raquel, course, to be there.

That was the original decision. That's what we'd have and we'd go and we'd make a massive statement. It's looking like the

I am not going to go, which is not a problem. So that basically means that as a collective without me, we have to work on a message and be secure on that message and be OK with being a salesman, for example, for a couple of weeks about these things.

Luis, I know you have a lot of natural practice in this. Others not so much natural practice in it, but everybody in this team is absolutely brilliant at talking about DeciWorld.

Caroline, in particular, you're very well respected in the way you speak about Deci, and everybody knows that. And so that's something that we just need to make sure we're aware of.

Caroline, the reason I can't go is because there is something happening in Asia at that time, and it basically is way more sense for me and Jelani to go to Japan and Taiwan at the beginning of August and then continue the Asia tour from there, rather than me go to Argentina for a month and then go to Asia after that.

It's just not, doesn't make sense. And you guys are more than capable of doing it without me. So I'm not going to go.

And I think it makes sense for Carolina the two Carlos is in particular to go Raquel Of course if you are in South America, and you're happy to take the journey then of course, please go Luis you are also welcome uninvited to attend on behalf of DC world and enjoy hanging out with a bunch of crypto dudes in a network state.

So whether you're Microsoft is like, okay, give me 50 grand. What are we going to do if it happens and we make it?

Your money is going to go 10 times for whatever 100 times and we're going to put it under your foundation, right?

We will write the smart contract so we can donate that for scientists or of AI or whatever. So we can appeal to different entities.

example, CEMEX, is the concrete producer in Mexico, it's got a big foundation as well. So I can say Allow me to do this for the research collective called the Collegio Ingenieros Civil Engineering.

It's about concrete and say hey You can donate me some cash and we will whatever the tokens are worth.

Joshua Bate
We will send it back to your Foundation, I think that's something we should consider as well Very strongly you'd be surprised how much money out is out there it for people that will donate it as long as you keep it pure and It's not As if you think that there's a genuine ability for these NGOs to invest directly into crypto for Humanitarian purposes we could even create a very simple NFT The NFT would basically be issued by a research collective the research collective Would be the same of the NFT the money would go to the research collective and you could have some kind of like Contribution tracking on the NFT and I think the NFT itself would be a more easy vehicle for investment

potentially even, who knows, for an NGO, because it could be considered some kind of art, some kind of gift piece.

then the proceeds, the details of the people that bought it can be contained in the NFT and you can have like some kind of like certification of the contributions and how that feeds back and all that can be stored on the NFT.

And then they can hold that on their balance sheet, which says I gave this charitable donation. And it says, this is the progress of the charitable donation.

And they can basically hold that on their balance sheet and say, this is a, this is a tax, even maybe a tax credit, right?

Like in the future, you could get potentially some tax burden, tax breaks in it. But yeah, I agree. We need to figure out a way to set that up so that could be possible.

I do agree with your point. And I think, as you mentioned, Louise, just directly giving it to the researchers through proof of knowledge through the research collective, sorry, it's just super powerful.

It's like, look, we're not even touching it, we're just giving it to the researchers and the money comes into the ecosystem and it's there for people to, as an incentive to create engrams.

And so it just drives the whole thing that less we have to, like, we don't need that much money internally, right?

What we need. need is the money to make the thing purr. And if the thing is purring because we've got charitable donations, we've got other things, we've got like research bounties from organizations.

And that whole decentralized economic ecosystem is actually working properly because of outside participants. We don't really need to spend money at all apart from our own salaries, right?

And so that's very, that's most of the outgoing, I think, from a treasury in the early stages is going to be like marketing and such and growth, right?

So if we can actually get that money for growth from other people, that's huge. Okay. Who has, like this meeting is scheduled for 45 minutes, right?

Does anyone have to leave in 15 minutes? Luis does. Okay. Carolina? No, okay. So I'm going to stick with the thing that's most relevant to you now, Luis, right?

There is something coming up called Cresemiento, which is in Argentina. It is a network state event. Luis, you're familiar with the network states?

The network state is a principle of basically setting up a city or a state, which is external from the nation state that, for example...

yeah.

Luis Maumajean
Yeah. No, I am. I am. am. Yeah. Okay. The one in Prospera in Honduras is very popular, right?

Joshua Bate
So there's a lot of success with this recently because people are excited about it. Balaji Srinivasan released a book.

Do you want to buy? Do you want to work with us for the next two months without a payment, but with a token allocation, which is highly incentivized and then see how that goes?

I've already spoken to three people. Two of them said yes. One is sort of thinking. So it's the right time in the market.

People are bullish enough to actually think like, okay, I want to get in on some of these token launches and I'm going to do the work.

So it feels a lot more like my home vibe, right? In the sense of being a definative crypto Degen guy to get people to get in the edge around getting the pre-sale and work for tokens.

At the same time, we're also probably going to do a KOL. around and I want to be clear on this so everyone's aware of what this means.

KOL is a key opinion leader. KOL is someone like an influencer basically but in crypto in particular is what we care about.

The KOLs are all like chills they're just basically like they just paid they're like politicians right you pay for their mouth right and that's in many ways not that great but they are unfortunately essential when you launch a decentralized token for the token sale to have any real traction as you need KOLs and so I know a bunch over the last few years I I know a bunch of good ones like you know legitimate it with integrity ones and I'm going to just basically pull together some things if you guys know any influential people then also let me know for a KOL we'll likewise do a token priest like you know we'll pay them in tokens or they can buy a larger allocation if they wish but KOLs tip

Basically, you offer shorter vesting periods so they can dump before everybody else. That's just how these guys roll, and if we want them, then that's just how it's going to have to be.

Last point on that race strategy is once the new documentation, the new deck is sort of ready, and the new messaging is ready, it's basically going to be, I'm going to go around all the contacts first, then I'm going to ask all the pre-down members to share it to two friends, as it has been suggested to me.

And then after this, when it comes to the token launch, basically, I'm going to prepare a little poster, and everybody is going to send them to all of their contacts that they've ever spoken to in crypto that they know holds crypto, and say, hey, we're doing this thing, and it will last like a week, the public sale will last like a week, and that's what everyone will have to do.

know no one wants to do that, but if you have friends that you trust, you should send them the poster.

That's what no one likes to shill, but that's we've got to do. So that's just kind of it on the race strategy switch up.

think it's important that you guys are aware of what's going on there, and any comments, let me know. But yeah, do we serve to you?

Quickly I agree ventured another way to go for this project.

Luis Maumajean
I think it's it's not gonna happen I I do have one guy that I want to call He's been investing in like six 16 doubts and it's about science.

It's called I'll send you a link in a minute So you never know might be a miracle there, but the truth is I think the way that I've been talking around here It's there's this company that I call Called bimbo, which is is the the largest barrette producer in the world and it's Mexican company and the owner It's don Lorenzo Cervighe.

He's a good man. He died already, but he he is a guy who actually care about others and his philosophy leads through the company profile and I talked to one of the guys and say hey, do you think we can get some money from these people if we allocate

on a smart contract to whatever the token increases over time, it's being given back to their own foundation and he said, yeah.

So I think that's another avenue we should be looking into to raise capital. It's to ask for money, not as charity.

The charity doesn't work to me, it destroys the human spirit, but as an investment for future benefit for others, right?

Joshua Bate
Great. I agree. Okay. Cool. Luis, once again, amazing. Thank you, brother. Really appreciate all of this. I'm very excited to move forward with it and get some great things together.

So this leads us pretty neatly into the next step, which is, I've spoken to most people about this in this call.

And so I don't want to spend too much time on that. Luis, I don't know if I mentioned it to you.

But it's basically a quick overview of what the next couple months looks like. And just a bit of a, I think I might have said everything to everybody in this call.

In separate occasions, but I'll just quickly breathe we go over if anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about Carolina, maybe you don't Please just let me know but I'll start by saying Of the back of Louise's brilliance.

I have a confession to make about myself over the last Three months. I've been trying to work to raise a seed round from VCs I felt like we had a strong enough product the market was a good enough position And that we deserve good money from I Just invited Hopefully hold on Hey, Carlos So I Felt like it was within our scope to go and raise to 2.5 mil from VCs After talking to about 30 VCs 30 to 50 VCs.

I can't you know on meetings with like at least 30 Double takeaway is there's a lot of money out there.

They are very much tied up by their structure. Like they have to have a very specific structure. has to be a SAFTA, has to be a token sale.

lot of them are a little bit more onto the equity side. We don't have the vehicles for these people and the way that they want.

And the vehicles that we want to use are basically reserve for crypto-native users. And so over the last three months, I've probably wasted a lot of time on the raising side by talking to VCs, learned a lot, met some good people, but ultimately further back than we should be right now on the funding goals because I focused on VCs when actually they weren't suitable.

So Pivot is announced today. But Pivot is back to the origins, which is the crypto-native investor, right? Which is how we started this, which we raised 400K over the last year from, which is what we're actually all about in this team.

Pretty much everybody in this team is pretty purist on the crypto. Luis, we haven't spoken too much about it, but it seems like you are also.

And so basically we're now like in the whole like VC mode, which is cool. It's quite exciting. Actually, I feel like I don't have to speak like a corporate person so much these guys anymore, we can actually be real people.

There's a lot that will have to change on my side personally, really kind of only my side on the messaging, which is like what the proposition is to an angel, and why why the road map towards the token launch is really exciting and the token launch, why that's going to be super bullish, right?

Like you can say all of this to VCs, but it's not as important to them. they have much more importance on like certain other terms, angels just want to know how bullish is it, how soon is it, and we're going to tell them on top of that.

On top of that, we have now got a lot of tokens that we're not selling to VCs. So we want to take some of those tokens and sell them to angels for sure.

We don't necessarily need to raise as much as we initially anticipated with VCs. So we're going to hold some of them.

Those few tokens that we're that small amount of the token supply that we're going to reserve, I am currently speaking with people to basically say, come do work with us.

can't pay you in cash, we'll pay you a nice sum in tokens and this is the roadmap. The same thing that I showed to the angel investors, I'm going to show to these prospective like contributors, which is this is how bullish the roadmap is.

This is how soon it is to the token launch. This is the price of getting on the token. These are some expected like if this market cap, then this price.

If you just check the group chat, I just screenshot something that I have, we've had in the discord for like three years now, is people who join our discord are able to give themselves on the tag so like their name in the discord has a certain color.

And these are just some selections that I chose. Obviously, just... arbitrary. I don't know how maybe something like this might be interesting, which is that you can have, again, we have planned this thing with the DCI World ID.

The DCI World ID would basically track your wallet and some interesting metrics from your wallet. So, for example, how many points you've got, what Ngram types you've been, you know, where the Ngrams are produced, or maybe if you've done something else on chain with another DCI protocol, we can do, we can track what we want on the wallets.

And I wonder if we could make the DCI World ID give a sort of label to the Ngram as like the creator.

So your DCI World ID can tell, you can tell people what you are. And so when people view the Ngram, they can say, this Ngram says blah, blah, blah, blah, it was produced by either a wallet address, if they're just purely a non, or if they have a DCI World ID, it can be like, Jay Bates, a DeFi person, or whatever.

And so you can get a bit more of a an overview of the person. Maybe it doesn't affect the tool, the points tracking, maybe it can be

use of filtering on the back end so you can filter out, like filter in only responses from verified researchers, for example.

That's something we can think about. But I think that's, I think that's a really great, really great direction. I don't know anyone else has any thoughts on that?

Eneko Uruñuela
Yeah, I mean, I went towards carrying as much data as possible. And then we can see what we do Yeah.

Not just for this world, for science, for humanity, right? who has more weight? A scientist that has the reason and a technical explanation of why weight lengths are doing what they're doing, or a guy who has 250 million followers or whatever, that might go their way and do what the scientists say.

So that's a game changer. says, we're in the pursuit of truth. That's science, right? And we are with what they're doing.

the world needs to improve ourselves as a race. That's what the science is looking for. The influencer is just trying to make money.

That's the truth at the end of the day. There's a few out there that might have a good heart or good intentions, but I think who's there to balance that?

Are we capable of doing that? Who are we to say what's more important? What I would do is let's put it out there.

Let's bring, we're not going to tell you at the first stage of Decide World who earns more value, more tokens, whatever.

I'm going to tell you what you say. This is a scientist, Engrams, just think about that. But I'm inviting you all, Mr.

Influencer, Mr. Doctor, pseudo-doctor or whatever, and Mr. Scientist. Come here and let us discuss. Let's have those roundtakers. books that you made or some sort of meetings or whatever, and let them come with a proposal.

I'm not going to say a solution, but I think that's what this award should be do. We should be that ecosystem that's a third side of opportunity for the guys and people out there smarter than me to let them decide who earns more tokens.

None who has a truth, because the truth, again, I'm for science, right? But how important is to have a guy who might tell 100 million young kids is like, you know, you shouldn't read a book once in a while, you should consider going to science instead of TikTok.

I think that's super valuable as well, right?

Joshua Bate
It's interesting what you say, and I wish Carlos Atox was here to hear it because he absolutely agrees with you on the terms of like let the people do the distribution as much as possible.

An echo.

Eneko Uruñuela
Bye. No, so what I would do is for sure have, on the technical side, have something or some way of showing if the creator of an angle is a scientist or not, or more like, you know, if this person is an influencer, whatever.

If we do that from the beginning, sort of, then in the future we could let users choose their feed of content, let's say, asking, well, I want to only want to hear from influencers, or I only want to hear from scientists.

And I say this because I expect some scientists to not value the end-game supporters, if they're not scientists in a way, or maybe value is not the right word, but maybe not the challenge.

problem the way they would trust the scientists. Of course the brain itself is going to be a proof of whether the value they're generating is good enough but having this on the technical side from the beginning I think is very important.

But yeah I also agree with the comment of the comment of what Wilson was making of influencers you know they have the following and if a scientist maybe needs to recruit people for an influencers have the audience to find these people.

So if we can somehow leverage this option that the brain is giving us that'll be really powerful I think.

Yeah I think yeah I think having the differentiation of at the very least

Joshua Bate
with a verified walk ID and not is important. agree with both the RIS and everybody also agreed that agnosticism on a points giving scale on our side is good.

The incentives that you give for those points we can basically find the exciting ways to make the more powerful knowledge or the more verified knowledge get more money.

But I think that again, I think Louise, as you mentioned, giving that to the communities to distribute through the research collective multi-signature wallets so they can set the research bounties.

They can say thank you for your contributions to this field, here's the money. They can do that. I think that's important.

Luis Maumajean
that is it's a health wellness and science okay so we need to come up with a name I already have some ideas there I'm gonna drop it and let everyone just go at it and the she's she's extremely passionate about these silo saving mushrooms and stuff like that she's gonna go really big and she's gonna bring a lot of important people from the industry from all of them and I think that's we can create a really cool pilot as a new research collective which is not a recognized institution but she will make sure that we bring enough scientists and enough laughs and enough people that might be interested so I think it's pretty cool so that's my update and I think it is extremely I loved it that she she proposed and I think that's what we want people like that understand them the true mission behind this world

Joshua Bate
It's huge firstly. Thank you so much for bringing this to us right like this is absolutely massive The senator I I see your you know I think you know that they want to be innovative as much as possible And we're providing them a brand new platform that shows their willingness to accept this really new exciting ticket It's for the good of science, but also for the good of their careers.

It's a huge move for them, of course, but massive massive Rossman I Have a few questions that I think we should spit ball on right now I think a talks is coming and we should wait for him because he might have some opinions on it as well, but primarily around the concept of We mentioned having different designations for contributions from scientists or citizen scientists or such things as this I Think that is possible In the sense that we can have a DID solution so your wallet can be connected and if you're a scientist We can have what we can call a scientist ID We have partnerships around that we can easily leverage to get people to have some kind of

Thank you. To have some kind of identifier attached to their wallet address as ZKID identifies it proves that you're a scientist of a certain type, but it doesn't provide any information.

We can have that. And so if you're a scientist and you sign in with your scientist login, then your scientist engrams are going to be labeled as such.

Now, the thing we need to think about is what OrkID, sorry, exactly, yes. OrkID, there's already an app that exists in right now that has OrkID login that attaches to your wallet address.

We don't have to build any of this. already exists. I don't know if it does OrkID, but I know one that does do OrkID.

But yes, if OrkID does it, then for sure, particular. What's important that we have to discuss, though, and I want Carlos to be here, I'm just going to ping him again.

He's going to come, think. Is how does the, yeah, he is coming, yeah. thing I want to know is like how are we deciding what effects that has as a user experience and part of the query experience of this was created by a scientist.

Is it just telling you that this was created by a scientist or does the scientist get more points? Does the scientist get preferential query like pulling?

Are we telling the AI to prefer the evidence from a scientist? Are we structuring it so that a scientist can have an engram as like a claim and then citizen scientists and such can go and add comments to it rather than like counterclaims in a scientific sense but more like oh yeah I've experienced this too or yeah this is what I do at home with my herbs and this is some of my thoughts or my my holistic healing clients have this experience.

It's not as structured as a scientist would do because it's a very specific process right but the scientific process is what I'm talking about but like do we have it so that the scientists are a separate almost end

that can be interacted with in certain ways. I'd like to hear people's thoughts on that.

Luis Maumajean
So if you ask me, it's super interesting what you just said. What's the mission? What's the end game here?

- Eneko Uruñuela: say, May 24th. I mean, you can. But if you do 05-24, I think it might get confused. Yeah, I mean. Americans, you know, they put it the other way around. Yeah.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Some of the numbers might be for months and for days for both of them. I don't know. I haven't tested it, so I don't know.
  - Joshua Bate: It's my intuition. I would say if you
  - Carlos Di Matteo: like the.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Date format that simulates natural language is the best one. So the whole-Yes, that's what I was trying
  - Eneko Uruñuela: to say.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: May, 7th, June, like the whole word.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: But we should have
  - Joshua Bate: that then as a force.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: The interface can generate that. Yeah, exactly.
  - Joshua Bate: We want it to just be a calendar that they click the date and
  - Carlos Di Matteo: then on the backend,
  - Joshua Bate: the interface does. Okay, cool.
  - Joshua Bate: That's great. So that makes sense. That's cool. Yeah, but if you
  - Eneko Uruñuela: already have an idea of what you're going to ask for in the different ontologies, you can send it to me and I'll think about it and see if there's any other options or ways to improve it. Yeah, Raquel, should we
  - Joshua Bate: book another call with Xenophon and I can prepare a draft of it beforehand, show it to him, and we can just work on some finer tuning?
  - Raquel Carrasco: Okay,
  - Eneko Uruñuela: it's not good
  - Joshua Bate: yet. Thank you. Okay, dope.

- Joshua Bate: he's a proper salesman. He has a few things in his own locker that he's proposed integrations with, like this Fractal NFT thing and the OpenForce, the other blockchain and stuff. I'm happy to hear the proposals. Doesn't mean we have to use them, but happy to hear the proposals. And if it's something that provides value, I'd love to support him on it. No problem. All right, guys. I think this has been good.
  - Joshua Bate: I
  - Eneko Uruñuela: don't think I'll join the call later. I have a formal dinner here in Oxford.
  - Joshua Bate: But I'll check
  - Eneko Uruñuela: the video or the summary if there's a summary. Yeah,
  - Joshua Bate: I'll just point out the bit about the changing of the strategy for the funding and the go-to-market. I think that would be something that I want you to see if you don't mind. So I'll just let you know when that is.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: okay one thing i'm
  - Raquel Carrasco: curious about that maybe like in a cruise related for after it's about the call in monday with the mexican people tonight oh the cicf yeah
  - Eneko Uruñuela: louis said he um they wanted to meet him first and then they brought up to the group
  - Raquel Carrasco: okay okay
  - Raquel Carrasco: Yeah, I think that's what he
  - Eneko Uruñuela: said like a few days ago.
  - Joshua Bate: Also, if you have the brain space, I know you're real, but that question I just mentioned, that comment I mentioned about the three ontologies for the housing, the event, and the person.
  - Joshua Bate: I don't know what's more optimal is like is three ontologies but maybe the ontology is quite complex is that gonna what are your thoughts on that like if you just have some thoughts on that over the next couple days and that would be cool my
  - Eneko Uruñuela: first intuition would be three is fine
  - Eneko Uruñuela: but have them very well structured, sort of like a table. Or like an Excel file that you would be filling in. I was thinking like
  - Joshua Bate: a form, like a Google form kind of vibe. Yeah,
  - Eneko Uruñuela: a form is not, yeah.
  - Joshua Bate: That's
  - Eneko Uruñuela: basically the UI. It's actually a form, really.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Yeah,
  - Joshua Bate: exactly. Exactly. That's what I was thinking for all these research collectives, really. It's just like specific ontologies with a structured form for the ontology to be submitted in this early stage, just
  - Eneko Uruñuela: before you get... Semantically, I mean, at the end of the day, we're looking into semantics here, right?
  - Eneko Uruñuela: So you will have whatever content you want right next to its keyword, right? Let's say, I don't know.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: the area of the house or how big it is right and then you'll have some info about it and they will go really close together in the same text piece of text um and so if we if if the structure is like a form i think it will be fine
  - Eneko Uruñuela: My only concern in terms of hallucinations would be regarding dates. Right. I don't know...
  - Eneko Uruñuela: um my guess is if the dates are properly written us in you know 24
  - Joshua Bate: 2024
  - Eneko Uruñuela: whatever it will be fine but i think that could be one of the
  - Eneko Uruñuela: the places where the AI could fail. I wonder if
  - Joshua Bate: we can have like, you know, when you go to fill out a calendar, what birthday is it says like you pop up and it's a little calendar and you click date that it's your birthday. I wonder if we have that and then we can control what the output of it looks like on the backend.
  - Joshua Bate: Yeah, that's super
  - Eneko Uruñuela: recent. Yeah, yeah. That's really easy to do. I wonder if we could make
  - Joshua Bate: that output very specifically structured for RAG LLM. I don't know if the typical MMDD YYY would be enough, or if we could have it more structured in some way.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: My guess is you would have to write it down.
  - Joshua Bate: As in,

- Raquel Carrasco: as well as profiling, checking that the housing is always full, the most efficient way. The thing is that build, I can also reuse it after for one of my projects like Bodyguard. So that is the kind of idea with Xenophon I want to talk again.
  - Raquel Carrasco: uh it just we need to finish by this week something before we can jump in something else me and carlos
  - Joshua Bate: sure um
  - Joshua Bate: For a bit more context, Carlos, the thing with Xenophone, this housing thing, the way that I suggested to Xenophone that it would work is that it would be basically a private research collective with a specific ontology. The ontology would be...
  - Joshua Bate: the the what's it the tenant's profile which is basically who they are where they are where they live or if they're a boy or a girl if they have any budgeting or any specific allergies or things like this that you would need to know for someone who's trying to live in a house and then you would have the other ontologies which would be the the house itself the actual unit so how big it is if there's any what kind of room space there is or this sort of thing
  - Joshua Bate: and then the events itself which is where these accommodations are tied to so if there's a conference in Berlin and he has some housing available for the Berlin thing then the events also have an ontology that's kind of roughly how I assumed it I think that the fewer ontologies that may be more complex ontologies would be better in this case
  - Joshua Bate: to more fields in the ontology. I don't know if that's the case, but more fields, but fewer ontologies would probably be better. And then it would just be in the initial early stages, it would just be a research collective, basically, where people can query, they can go to the website and say,
  - Joshua Bate: you know, what's happening in Berlin, where should I stay? And it will be like, well, based on your profile, you should look at this house because it matches what you're interested in. Or here's some available housing, you know.
  - Joshua Bate: which one are you interested in and you'll be like i'm interested in this one but okay yeah you're suitable for this because you have your budget is high enough and you're accepting you're happy to stay with both a mixed mixed sex mixed gender uh house and stuff so that's all i thought for it i felt like that's simple enough and i don't know what your thoughts are do you think that would work guys
  - Joshua Bate: For matching people and housing, I think that would work, yeah. It makes sense.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: I mean, as a product sense, it makes sense to me.
  - Joshua Bate: And it's what we're already building. It would just be different ontologies, right, within the interface.
  - Joshua Bate: Yeah,
  - Raquel Carrasco: actually we had that discussion the other day, me and Eniko with Luis, and he was just pushing us to say like, yeah, that's a great product. We should also use it for commercial uses. Who? Luis
  - Joshua Bate: said that.
  - Joshua Bate: yeah. Luis is such a commercial guy. I'm very glad to have him on the team. He brings a touch of, he's cutthroat, you know, that's what we like. Someone who comes in and is just like, let's get the fucking money. This is what people want to see. He's a proper salesman. He is a proper salesman.
  - Joshua Bate: I mean, I don't know what he sounds like in Spanish, but in English, he's so eloquent. I'm like, when I first met him, I thought he was a scammer. I was like, there's no way Luis is like this real. Like he's so eloquent and so convincing and stuff. I was like, he's even better with Spanish. I think I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, he must be selling me something, but he wasn't. He was just.
  - Joshua Bate: I just loved what we were doing. Or not
  - Eneko Uruñuela: yet. Maybe you haven't noticed. Hey, look,

- Joshua Bate: Something I'll talk to them about. We can even probably speak to them openly about it tomorrow. The thing is, which I didn't mention, in this period here in June, they're building something for a project that I actually designed their protocol for them as a consultancy. Basically, it's just a slightly different, more privatized version of the Research Collective infrastructure in some ways, right?
  - Joshua Bate: It's different, but like there's some similarities to the research collective infrastructure, in particular the spawning of an independent contract system that you can use for governance. Mickey's going to be building that in June. So he's going to basically be getting a whole bunch of research and experience on the exact thing that we want built, done through someone else's contract.
  - Joshua Bate: right so that is something to be aware of is that he's going to basically build research collectives in some respect for for this other company and then when it comes to july he'll have loads of experience on doing the research collective so that's just something to be aware of
  - Carlos Di Matteo: right
  - Joshua Bate: yeah that makes sense
  - Carlos Di Matteo: my only two cents is let's speak to him about it just to know if we can do anything because i don't want them to be like no you did this you um and then
  - Carlos Di Matteo: The second part of that is even if Mickey comes in, like I'm just saying, like if in June we can do something and even if Mickey comes in and has a lot of experience and he can do it 30 times faster, Mickey's a thousand times more expensive than us.
  - Joshua Bate: You are right. You are correct. So I'm going to speak with Dan. He's more the business guy. He's the guy
  - Carlos Di Matteo: handling all the business
  - Joshua Bate: side. I'm going to speak with Dan and just let him know that we're having this conversation about some things that maybe we can achieve in the same time that they wanted to, that they would program to achieve. And if that's the case, like, is that going to be a problem? Is that going to be better? You know, what's their thoughts on that? So I'll speak with Dan before the call tomorrow. But in this call that we have next after this, let's
  - Joshua Bate: um let's just assume that we can build whatever we want and just
  - Carlos Di Matteo: brainstorm along
  - Joshua Bate: those lines right yeah that makes sense
  - Carlos Di Matteo: okay i think that's all internal uh raquel do you want to go
  - Raquel Carrasco: no i mean we are like building
  - Raquel Carrasco: some kind of interfaces, you know, for other people and all of them integrate the idea of proof of knowledge. Once we have the protocol to adapt that interfaces should not be difficult. We are just doing that now. I don't know if I'm missing something.
  - Raquel Carrasco: I
  - Carlos Di Matteo: wish I would just if if you ask me I would just say what's up with lemonade and what's up with the suzala guy that you were talking with Josh I don't know what was going on but
  - Joshua Bate: that's
  - Carlos Di Matteo: something that I remember yeah
  - Raquel Carrasco: Casey we are just trying to throw this out there index it's just like we are just jumping from one thing to another we don't have enough time so
  - Raquel Carrasco: I guess we will, I mean we are building now something but for Christina from Lens but actually the integration is the same thing that for KC so it's like two in one as soon as we have it we send it to KC that is the guy from Lemonade.
  - Raquel Carrasco: Chenaphone. Okay, Chenaphone, it will be another interface, mainly, mainly, yeah, kind of integration. It's a cool guy and met him in Buenos Aires and keeps doing a housing solution. So actually what he needs coordination for, it's actually the people joining the houses.

- Joshua Bate: Like they're giving us a discount because of this situation right like a 15 grand or 10 grand discount. I remember But that's still assuming the full scope of work also, I Know we discussed this but I completely forgot We're doing that we're doing the UX
  - Carlos Di Matteo: yes,
  - Joshua Bate: I completely forgot that
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yes, none of the interface, like what that's, that's one of the things when you said interfaces and that Mickey was going to get to the interfaces or whatever, or whatever. First, I don't think he's doing that. And second, if he was willing to, we don't want him on that. The
  - Joshua Bate: interfaces, as you see, but the color coding is primarily, I think nerd. And that means not just nerd in the sense of Carlos and Raquel. I mean, I've been speaking to some people who could, we could consider intern, right? who are really interested in what we're doing i said look we can't pay you we're happy to give you some token allocations um and we want you to bring your creativity and your ideas to building cool interfaces to prove knowledge so that in the first few months we have a bunch of dope things for people to use and there's a couple of these guys who are interested in that and i basically said
  - Joshua Bate: join nerd right like and in the long run i think they'll be happy at nerd uh making good money from developing uh but the idea is that they would introduce them to cars and raquel and you two would basically show them what we got on the interface front and then uh experiment these guys are you know young and excited so they'll provide some cool feedback yeah that makes sense
  - Carlos Di Matteo: so yeah interfaces
  - Joshua Bate: that's all us um i meant the interface of just like how to interact with the on-chain research collective, how to claim your tokens, all that kind of shit.
  - Joshua Bate: And then the
  - Carlos Di Matteo: thing is, I believe, so the question comes in because I don't think we can build a scoring system in a month, but I do think we can do the research collective part because I think like, it's not me. Like I'm not the master of this, but Josh, you and Atox have a lot of, a lot of.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Like you know what the Etherian OS thing is doing we can just build an MVP with the Etherian OS thing and that's it. We can build an
  - Joshua Bate: MVP with the Etherian OS. I don't actually want to use the Etherians OS. They do have a new UX. Well the
  - Carlos Di Matteo: other thing that Mickey suggested we can just like we I think that's something we can work on. Well yeah
  - Joshua Bate: I think there's libraries that we can use. I think we could even copy some of the Etherians OS contracts. We could partner with them on some things. The problem with the Etherians OS contract is just that it's It's great for what it is, which is like allowing groups of people to get together and deploy dope DAOs on mainnet.
  - Joshua Bate: It's what we want to do, but ours has a specific focus. And so we shouldn't have extra tools that people don't need, and we should have the exact tools that people need. Let's say it's not
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Ethereum OS. Doing a governance system is not hard. That's what I'm saying. Like, if I were to code a governance thing tomorrow, that's not hard.
  - Joshua Bate: are
  - Carlos Di Matteo: basically standard. So what I think is in that downtime, we can focus on getting the DAO side and the sub-DAO side with progress because we know how to do the scoring system. We're not going to go into the scoring system because that's something we expect from them. Can we beat progress on the other thing while they're not there? Okay. That's a good question.

- Joshua Bate: Yeah, cool. Thank you. So yeah, that's generally by the end of May, we'll have the attestations that can be queried on a global brain. And then July, we'll probably build the points tracking and stuff like the Merkle trees and such.
  - Joshua Bate: And then token launch will launch with the token with no sub-DAO infrastructure, but with incentives for people to generate engrams. And then hopefully the interfaces will be a big driver there. And then hopefully sub-DAO infrastructure towards October sometime, and then token sinks and all kinds of cool shit. Okay. So
  - Carlos Di Matteo: first question, when you say that we're going like, What we're going to have at the end of May is, correct me if I'm wrong, the integration with Ceramic and Index Network working.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: And I believe there is a Merkle tree, which is the Engram Merkle tree, like the Engram creation Merkle trees. I don't know
  - Joshua Bate: about the last point, but the first two points, yes. The difference is it won't be like full power because it won't have that additional layer of compression. It would just be straight up the Engrams themselves.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: I just wanted to understand because if it's going to be this, like what I thought at the start is if this MVP is going to be the same thing that we already have, then let's put him on something else, right? But yeah, if it's going to be ceramic with index network and
  - Joshua Bate: not Mongo and that kind of stuff, then it
  - Carlos Di Matteo: makes sense. So
  - Joshua Bate: what we have already is what we're doing now in this period of time there, right? And what they're going to build is going to allow us to...
  - Carlos Di Matteo: connect
  - Joshua Bate: them and also whatever you put in here can be properly attested to the correct network like through the ceramic streams and stuff okay um bear in mind we're talking with them tomorrow so that's why i'm giving you this context now so you can uh yeah that
  - Carlos Di Matteo: makes sense what we should do our priority is make sure we have clear what we want from mickey at the end of may and he knows that what we want is possible that should be the conversation tomorrow because i don't want to end up with, at the end of May, him delivering something that we already have.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Okay, cool.
  - Joshua Bate: So in the core team call today, because the detail on this is less relevant to everybody else. Everyone who needs to know the detail of this has already been told. Now you guys. So I'm just going to whiz through this announcement in the core team call just quickly. But let's use some time in that to align to figure out what it is with Jelani and Carolina. And hopefully Atox will be there as well messaging. That makes
  - Carlos Di Matteo: sense. And we can
  - Joshua Bate: align on what we want from there. I think that's a good point. Cool. Yeah,
  - Carlos Di Matteo: that makes sense. And then, I agree with the July period being the scoring system. Because that's like, the scoring system is the thing that DeSai World can't build in the short term. Like, if we want to build a scoring system, it's going to take us a while.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah, and they can do it faster. So that's what they should be doing. They should be doing things that we can't do and brings me to my second point, which is what can we do? What can we do in that June off period in order to first Take advantage of it because we don't want to be sitting on our asses. Well, so that is not there. Absolutely Yeah, we have hands and then the second part is
  - Carlos Di Matteo: If we are able to progress on things that we expected Solident to do, so maybe this sounds... Maybe that's good because first, we pay less money. Second, we progress faster. So there's two questions for there. The first one is, is that an issue with Solident? If we build things that we wanted them to build while they were not there, is that going to be a problem? Good question. Great question.

- Joshua Bate: And then that would mean that it's going to be much easier to keep this coherent in the early stages, just in the beta phase, whilst they're out doing the building, they're doing something else in June. And so what we can actually do is onboard research collectives and have them use it and it's more powerful, but then we can actually have the global query of our brain and start getting some feedback from this as to what, like, you know, this is going to have like five or six ontologies, how coherent can we get it? And basically from here, do we have a chat function where people can query the global brain and start? getting do they get referred to the individual research collectives or does it actually just pull the information directly from the Ngram from that research collective right is it like a direct answer or is it a reference to the research collective
  - Joshua Bate: So that's kind of the stage I think we should be at by the end of this month. Technically, Solident, Mickey says he'll be there. He's just going to code for the next three weeks and make that happen. Then after that, we're thinking token launch. I'm thinking token launch here, end of August, around that. We'll see what the market says, but that's what I'm thinking. This period here, we could choose. Do we want the on-chain contract factories of the research collectives? DAOs with all the tokens and the multisig and stuff? Or do we want points issuance and tracking and such things as that?
  - Joshua Bate: those are our two choices to get done in this month by the potential token launch end of August. I initially thought, let's do the research collectives and so you can have the sub dials for the utility for the token. But within the same call, I actually reversed and said, let's do the points tracking so that by the time the token goes live, what we can have is people actually earning money from putting engrams in. And then over this period of time, maybe a month, two months, maybe October sometime, then people will be earning, right? the tokens and then when the research collective sub down for goes live, they can actually use those tokens. But people will have them. There'll be a distribution of these tokens. There'll be some hype. And I think this period here, this is what I'm going to touch on the core team call this period here. Token launch until the end of the year. Probably. I think that comes really strongly down to the interfaces.
  - Joshua Bate: So the research collectives, which is what DeSci World is all about, right, at the moment, like that's what we want to do. That's going to be like, obviously, forever, right? But that's going to be a big focus up until the token launch for us because we can do them locally, right? We don't need the token for these to be cool. The interfaces are cool, but less cool without like the token issuance and the points tracking and stuff. And so I think from the token launch time until the end of the year, maybe even the end of the bull run. I think the interfaces is going to be where we're going to get most of our value from. Obviously, research collectors, we continue when the sub DAOs go live. That's a whole new catalyst. But I think that's something that will come into play around the time of token launch because it will be fun. People use it. They'll get paid for it. And so that's just the general timeline that I think is important. This is going to happen June.
  - Joshua Bate: if we think, unless we have any massive disagreements, I think this should happen, that we take the June off. In this period, Mickey suggested, I don't know exactly what his thoughts were, that you, Carlos, and Carlos get together and basically just figure out what we have that we can add into this. And I don't know what he had in mind, but he had some thoughts. And Atox said some things as well that you guys would work on something. I'm not sure. But in that June period, you guys can build on it. Yeah.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: I'm going to let you finish and then I'm going to ask some questions.

- Joshua Bate: for the money from VCs or maintain our stuff and don't get money from VCs. And so we're going to just do the latter and maintain our, maintain ourselves and not go for VCs, which means that we're probably going to raise less than the initial idea of 2 million, which is what we're hoping to raise. We don't need 2 million. We need about 500K. That's just the background. Anyways, so Soledon, I was honest with Dan, my friend, founder of Soledon, about this situation and said, basically what the money I thought I'd have now will probably happen. sometime in the next couple months um and you know are you going to still build it and he was like needs to go speak to mickey and stuff so they spoke and they said look we're happy to keep building it but here's here's a suggestion they have a job which they could do in june that they want to put mickey on right
  - Joshua Bate: And the job is actually a company that I took to them, right? Like I referred this company to solid and just to see if they could do it. And then they did the scoping and like, this should be Mickey and Mickey's on Deesaw world. So why don't we take Mickey off Deesaw world for the whole of June? He can go and do that thing. They're giving us a $15, 000 discount for taking him off in June. Solid and all. And then in that month of June, Basically, I just make sure I have the money because I basically said to Dan, I'll secure the debt of the build if I need to with my own funds, which I definitely don't want to do. And Dan doesn't want to do that to me either. So he's basically saying, take a month to just make sure you have all your finances in order. And then you can decide if you want to take on more debt if it's you're still struggling to raise. And I think it's prudent. I think it's smart. And we spoke about it.
  - Joshua Bate: me, Mickey and Dan together on a meeting yesterday or two days ago. And the reason also, sorry, the reason he can't do August is because his second child is being born in August. So he's taking a month off, which is great. Congratulations to him. So we would have up until the end of May here and then the whole of July and then from August onwards. So timeline wise, I basically said, okay, let's, I'll cover this in the core call as well, but let's get by May, by the end of May, something where we can basically onboard. with research collectives, okay? Where we can basically have the system that Carlos you're designing and you're Neko designing of having this local brain where you can start submitting specific ontologies to have a local queryable vault.
  - Joshua Bate: Let's do something along those lines. And basically his point was, I can get it. He says he reckons by May, he can get it to a point where the local research collective interface with its specific ontologies can attest to the global brain, right? And the global brain will be queryable. So these local research collectives can exist, but they can also attest to the global brain. So my suggestion was, look, if by May, that's what we're going to have, we... I said to him about like the haikus and stuff and he said like he's going to try that. I said, why don't we just not do the compression of any kind for May and just literally restrict the amount of ontologies that we can provide to people through the research collectives, five, six tops, the same ones on all of them.

- Joshua Bate: And also it'll be really powerful comparisons for when we do our own model as well. We'll have some good time.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Absolutely. Yeah. And this is all based on research being done at Google, actually. The papers I've been reading are mostly from either students or engineers at Google. This is a good stuff. Yeah. Straight from
  - Joshua Bate: the, straight from the heart darkness. Good. Yeah. I'll talk about solid in just one sec. Carlos, have you and Anika spoken about the interface stuff that I spoke about? We
  - Carlos Di Matteo: just did. What, just now? Yeah, just now. Sorry, looking at something
  - Joshua Bate: else. Sorry about that. No, it's
  - Carlos Di Matteo: fine. No, no, no, you were
  - Eneko Uruñuela: doing your laptop. Oh, okay, okay,
  - Joshua Bate: cool. I really missed that. And that's basically, to recap, Carlos is going to do it and Ineco, you're going to be his test subject and figure out what the right ontologies are, right?
  - Carlos Di Matteo: That's why Ineco, I don't know if you heard, but he was like, if you...
  - Carlos Di Matteo: if he asked me if I wanted him to design the rest of like the options for input in the little UI that he did. And I was like, do as you wish. You need
  - Joshua Bate: to do.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah. Yeah. So
  - Joshua Bate: I need to give this talk to everybody in the, in the team. I've already spoken to a toxin Jelani and maybe even Carolina about it. I need to tell everybody. I'm maybe repeating myself to some people, but it's also about Soledad. I'll talk about the Soledad thing here just so we can talk about it privately if we need to, I guess. But basically, Soledad, I'm going to share my screen, do a little diagram. Soledad have been with us for April and May. They will not be with us in June. They'll come back in July. And then they will not be with us in August. And then they'll be with us for the rest of however long we need. This is April.
  - Joshua Bate: So I'll explain why. Here is June, right? And basically I spoke, because these are my friends, right? So I don't have my friends and they're doing us a favor. Basically, we haven't paid anything yet and they're doing a high quality build for us and we're going to pay them in the future once we get the money, right? Which is something that probably would never happen. But with our recent strategy change, which I'll talk about a little bit more in the... the core call today um about basically i've essentially wasted three months of raising by targeting vcs right it's sort of something that i felt after the pre-seed at the end of last year moving into this year we've got a lot more product a lot more clout the space is happening the market's going vcs will love it we can raise loads of money
  - Joshua Bate: cool vcs did love it uh they love the product they love the idea they just didn't love our model which is no saft and selling an lp position rather than selling the token straight they just i should have known didn't really realize just how much it's just very extractive and they're not interested in sort of anything ground you know like ground up or anything really heavily community based or anything that like provides a lot more equity to the users rather than just the investors and stuff uh equity in terms of equality right um so speaking to a lot of vcs a lot of great learnings a lot of great feedback a lot of great connections but no money from the bcs and in the end i've just sort of realized that that's we were always an angel only thing we were never going to raise from vcs before then people started telling us how sick our product was and i guess i was like that's where he says money uh i don't we have to basically decide to compromise on some of our goals

- Eneko Uruñuela: results of the mongo
  - Carlos Di Matteo: query to the vector so let's see i don't know yeah
  - Eneko Uruñuela: that's what i mean that's what i meant then with the output of the query you create a new embeddings maybe space
  - Carlos Di Matteo: and you
  - Eneko Uruñuela: use that specifically yeah that
  - Carlos Di Matteo: also makes sense I briefly remember
  - Joshua Bate: hearing
  - Joshua Bate: Atox talking about MongoDB queries doubling up on them and having them go like something like this. I don't know. I briefly remember him saying something like what you say, so you should run that by him as well.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up the project and connect it to do the base use case, and then I'm probably going to sync with Atox and say like, hey, can you dump your brain on me? Yes.
  - Joshua Bate: Show me the ways somehow. Yeah. So that's
  - Carlos Di Matteo: something we want to do. That's on my side. Carlos,
  - Eneko Uruñuela: do you want me to design the other input? Feel
  - Carlos Di Matteo: free to do whatever. You need to tell me what to do. So the best way to do that, go ahead. OK. And then I do want to know if there's any updates on the metrics thing that you were talking about. Obrigado
  - Carlos Di Matteo: yeah
  - Eneko Uruñuela: so not much because i've been sick and it's difficult to focus but um let me show you i've started the documentation for the where is this um
  - Carlos Di Matteo: can
  - Joshua Bate: you see my screen
  - Eneko Uruñuela: yep okay i've started the documentation for the for the repository this is like a very brief overview but for the metrics um I've written the actual maths of the main concepts. And then I've explained every single metric we're going to be using more precisely. And then I've been working on the code itself, restructuring it to make it a
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Python package that you can install and you can run from your terminal. So right now I'm focusing on like the main pipeline where you've got some options you can pass through the terminal and then this will be like you load your local model with LM Studio for instance. You could load your embeddings. If you want to use your Obsidian ones, this is still something I have to update. And then basically either we do this, there's something that they're doing in one of the papers I read, or we just go straight into asking the question and the metrics will come here. Calculate metrics, basically. And then generate.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: report
  - Eneko Uruñuela: report
  - Eneko Uruñuela: or add to CSV files. Yeah, I'm working on the main structure and slowly adding things. The idea is to make it as simple as possible so that then we can add more features if we need them. That makes sense. Can you send that
  - Carlos Di Matteo: doc link on the telegram just so we can read it?
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Oh, it's on... If you have a look at the readme, I have a line that explains how to run it locally.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Cool.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: My goal is to have it finished by the end of the month. Because now with my in-laws coming tomorrow.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: I don't know how much time I'll have this coming week.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: So that's
  - Joshua Bate: the analysis of the model and the hallucinations, right? Yeah, so the idea
  - Eneko Uruñuela: is to have different metrics of how faithful or how much our setup is hallucinating. So we can plug in different models. We can do embeddings with smart connections plus Lama 3 or embeddings with OpenAI plus, I don't know, Google's Gemini.
  - Joshua Bate: have like a ranking
  - Eneko Uruñuela: and see which one is the most accurate or the one that takes most of the boxes that then we can offer as part of POK. Wonderful. And
  - Joshua Bate: I think that that's really like all of this stuff is super bullish for me to be able to go out and show people how serious we are.

- Carlos Di Matteo: But yeah, it's fine. That's cool. So yeah, on the update side, Locastic again, they had a couple issues with. Web3, they implemented a picket, an API called picket for like Web3 auth. It was a shit show, so they dropped it now. They also did a little auth rework on like the Web2 side of the auth. That's fine. Yeah, that's like this week. I think I'm going to receive an update from Mo either end of this week or start of the next two. We've been
  - Joshua Bate: pushing changes to the verse L because the verse L that I've been looking at hasn't changed in a month at least No,
  - Carlos Di Matteo: it has but you need to so what what they are working on is
  - Carlos Di Matteo: logged in functionality. So you need to connect your wallet, try to create a project. They're working on like the forms. Yes, I saw the forms.
  - Joshua Bate: I think everything's a little bit too big. I think everything on the screen is too large. I think the forms need to be smaller. I think the text might need to be smaller. I also think the dashboard doesn't look good right now. Like the front page, the homepage, the blocks are too big. They're too blocky. Why did you
  - Carlos Di Matteo: not say this in the meeting? Yeah, I don't know,
  - Joshua Bate: man. I'm just thinking like I've been thinking it for a while. I don't know why I didn't say this. Yes. Anyways, I'll speak to them about that as well. No worries. But
  - Carlos Di Matteo: I agree. They are big. Too
  - Joshua Bate: big. OK, cool. That
  - Carlos Di Matteo: makes sense.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah, so that's all good. What I want to try to do in this project is have, like, I want to see if we can filter the vector search queries so that, like, if, I don't know if this is possible. I haven't looked into it. But, you know, like, the vector search works.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: how it does with the dimensions and everything. I want to see if you can further refine it like filters, like with filters. So for example, vector search in this limited amount of n-grams, for example. I want to see if that's possible because-It should be. At the end of the
  - Eneko Uruñuela: day, you can save the embeddings as an embeddings file, or you can create a new one very easily with OpenAI or whatever. So one way to do it is, and I think the easiest way, is to come up with some tags or something that will be reflected on Mongo.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: Yeah. And for every end ground, there will be a tag or a bunch of tags. And then you can filter by tags, for instance. That would be a simple solution. That's what I want
  - Carlos Di Matteo: to do. The only thing is that when you do the vector search, you do it through a Lama SDK. So I don't think you have direct access to the Mongo query that they run, but probably. So it's just like... I mean, you should be
  - Eneko Uruñuela: able to, right? I'm in ignorance
  - Carlos Di Matteo: yet. Technically, you should be able to. But it's a matter of if the SDK gives you the opportunity to further extend the query or if you have to hack it. OK,
  - Eneko Uruñuela: I see what you mean.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: OK. But yeah, ideally,
  - Eneko Uruñuela: that's what I would
  - Carlos Di Matteo: do. Extract everything
  - Eneko Uruñuela: filtered, I don't know, hashtag.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: File with that.
  - Eneko Uruñuela: yeah it
  - Carlos Di Matteo: translates into a vector search mongol query so technically like on the technical universe you just need more stuff to that query the thing is does the llama sdk let you and i'll i'll take a look it should be but i'm in ignorance right now because i haven't looked into it why
  - Eneko Uruñuela: are you doing all the queries with llama
  - Carlos Di Matteo: the queries are in llama yeah i mean yeah because it's the vector search so the vector search you do it with the llama sdk okay yeah um because i mean otherwise
  - Eneko Uruñuela: you can just use mongol i
  - Carlos Di Matteo: mean yeah yeah maybe maybe the way to do it is do a mongo query and then feed the

Weekly devs meeting May 9th, 2024
- **Transcript**: 
  - Joshua Bate: looks nice on our ux but when they click view view page it takes them back to the old one if we want to do that we could do that um we shouldn't
  - Carlos Di Matteo: do that i think they could easily like mo can easily transfer our mongodb collections to their database and just pull that perfect
  - Joshua Bate: but yeah we'll see okay let's do that um but my
  - Carlos Di Matteo: point about them with requirements
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah,
  - Joshua Bate: I think we can get something from them. Marco is, they're good guys. I'm, I'm speaking with, uh, Antonio, by the way, I'm speaking with Antonio next week. So if you have anything you want, that's the founder of like, I think if you want me to say anything to him about anything, if you have any feedback for me to give him about them and the work and anything like that, just let me know. Um, the minting with wearable, we're going to want to mint like, okay. So for example, spinal cord, right? Say there's a spinal cord V2. We want to, be able to find a cool project, onboard the Mintory ecosystem and say, right, we're going to allow you to mint through our website. We're going to host your collection on our website and you can mint it. And then once it's minted, you can natively trade in the marketplace on our website as well. So it's like a wearable marketplace, but it's just on our website. So it's only specific B-Side collections. Some of them are, maybe some other ones that get listed, but we basically have a very few amount of...
  - Carlos Di Matteo: things. It's normal. I think
  - Joshua Bate: it's good. I think I'm going to use that when I talk with Antonio, I'm going to use that. I'm going to be like, we're actually helping you.
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah. I mean,
  - Joshua Bate: it's like, it's like free consultancy on, on a lot of like
  - Carlos Di Matteo: free consultancy, but it's like we scoped the web three product and you were all like, yeah, cool. And now you're struggling with it. And that's not on me.
  - Joshua Bate: That's not on me. That's not on us. Yeah. We're
  - Carlos Di Matteo: still there to support. Like I'm, I'm. The thing is,
  - Joshua Bate: I don't think there's any animosity with Antonio. I basically said to Antonio a couple months ago, stupidly, I said,
  - Joshua Bate: let's buy you out of your token position because we gave him a great price on the token position right and i was like let's just buy you out with cash and they were like we don't want to do that and i was like come on man we want to keep our tokens and stuff we don't have any cash to do that right now so thank god they said no uh but we're gonna assume touch on that subject when i speak to him but i just there's no animosity it's just like we're doing business right so i'm hoping that this this is something that i can sort of say is like we're kind of helping you guys get into the web3 space because Your guys don't know shit and we're giving free tech advice really. Yeah
  - Carlos Di Matteo: Yeah, okay cool. And that's the horrible
