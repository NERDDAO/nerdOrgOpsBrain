I had a call with Sun and Koko, the two persons that are organizing the "Use Cases" week in crecimiento, KoKo i don't know her, aparently she has onboarded recently the organization through Sun, because he did MuAcra in Ghana. So, aparently she is connected with ETH Safari and she has a neuroscience background, so she was excited to organize a DeSci Day during Crecimiento, so she is going to be helping between us and them to organize it. She aparently is in DeSci too, she know Boris, she asked me if I knew him. 

The thing is that I ended pitching her PoK, and she love it, so I see the possibility to partnership with them somehow, maybe as a Research collectives, they are also setting up a Forum for post Aleph (Aleph it's the name for the popup city in August, Crecimiento is for the 2 years plan), so we could connect that forum with PoK somehow (she complained about the coordination problem for having to check so many forums, telegrams groups, etc so I pitched her also our Obsidian Brain so she could have an idea @Plat0x_eth ), I think that could be interesting if I can introduce her to you @Gingerheart86 and maybe @JBate7 you can also talk with her since could connect us with the African community (also interesting for the Devcon event)
