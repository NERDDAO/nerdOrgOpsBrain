He did sort of confirm what I expected: that we could have a source/original engram  that could then be compressed into key highlights that are connected to the og in the graph. This strengthens the value of the highlights while still providing the original context.

Brian, the creator of Smart Connections, got back to me re: whether literature notes connected to their source would make the AI perform better. This is what he said:

Hey, Aniko, and thanks for the question. I think that the answer would be linking to the source from multiple notes would make those notes more likely to appear as relevant in the connection algorithm.

Having the entire paper available, I think, would serve a bit of a different purpose than simply finding the most similar or relevant content to whatever your current context is. I think that there's a lot of other opportunities to explore this sort of setup from...

Potentially even including the source doc when you're, say, using the chat and it pulls in a note as context. Something I am currently thinking about is making smart connections have the ability to utilize non-markdown type of documents.

So I am trying to figure out what that might look like and I'm thinking that there will be some sort of markdown representation of the document for ease of implementation reasons. So what I come up with when it comes to connecting that source document content to the entities within smart connections that are used to perform the retrieval and connection making process, I think what I come up with there might have some impact on what you are trying to do, but I also can't say for sure because personally, I don't take any kind of responsibility for that.

I don't take a substantial amount of notes on literature. Most frequently, my notes are project related, so it's a little bit of a different context than what you're working with.

I hope that answers at least some of your question or clarifies something. If there's anything I can follow up with, please let me know.

And thanks for using Smart Connections.

Our "Science is Cool" campaign will highlight how blockchain technology and decentralized science enable individuals to take direct and meaningful action on critical issues such as climate change, personalized medicine, and sustainability. Through virtual events, artistic collaborations, and presence at festivals and youth gatherings, we will show that supporting science is not just a responsibility but a badge of visionary, leading, and yes, incredibly cool people.

Furthermore, we will leverage social media platforms to launch challenges and competitions that foster active participation in scientific projects with a focus on tangible results and real improvements. These activities will be designed to be viral, easy to share, and above all, transformative, showing that being part of DeSci World is to be at the forefront of positive change.

By making science a trend and associating it with popular figures and relevant cultural movements, we will not only increase our user base but also create a community of passionate advocates who will see DeSci World not just as a platform, but as a movement. This approach not only captures the imagination and energy of the younger masses but also provides them with a platform for their voices and actions to have a real and measurable impact.

These strategies are designed to work in synergy, creating a robust ecosystem that not only attracts investment and talent but also establishes DeSci World as an undisputed leader in the field of decentralized science. This is our path towards growth and innovation, and with your support, I am confident that we will achieve our ambitious objectives.

Thank you once again for your attention and your continued commitment to our shared vision. Together, we will not only change the landscape of science and technology but will also redefine what it means to be an agent of change in this modern era.

Sincerely,

Luis Maumejean

**Media Strategy**
Our first pillar focuses on the media. The strategy here is not only to inform but to inspire and mobilize resources through these platforms. We will seek to establish strategic alliances with key media that share or identify with our vision of innovation and scientific progress. Through these channels, we will launch stories and content that highlight the importance and impact of DeSci World on science and society. This will include documentaries, exclusive interviews, and a series of articles that narrate our victories, challenges, and the profound relevance of our work. We want the media not only to report on us but to become advocates for our cause, mobilizing their networks and resources to support our mission.

**Strategy for Opinion Leaders and Influencers**
The second pillar is directed at opinion leaders and influencers who, although they are not researchers, have the ability to motivate the masses. We will implement an engagement campaign where these influencers will be invited to participate in events, talks, and interactive sessions with our team, experiencing firsthand the power and potential of DeSci World. Their task will be to share these experiences with their audiences, using their influence to generate a movement of support and enthusiasm around our project. This personalized approach will not only increase our visibility but will also foster an emotional connection with our brand and mission.

**Strategy for Knowledge Developers**
To attract knowledge developers, our strategy will focus on highlighting DeSci World as an epicenter of innovation and scientific collaboration. We will launch a series of initiatives, such as hackathons, collaborative publications, and scholarship programs, that not only provide recognition and rewards but also demonstrate the tangible impact of knowledge contributions within our platform. Additionally, we will implement gamification systems that reward ongoing participation and contribution, making the experience of collaborating with DeSci World rewarding both intellectually and professionally.

**Strategy for Research Centers and Academia**
Finally, our fourth pillar seeks to attract academic institutions and research centers. To achieve this, we will present DeSci World as an indispensable strategic partner at the forefront of science and technology. We will offer access to our platform as a resource to expand their reach and capabilities, as well as the opportunity to lead global collaborative projects that could define the future of their respective fields. Through seminars, webinars, and joint symposia, we will reinforce the value of a partnership with DeSci World, showing how our collaboration can lead to advances that would otherwise not be possible.

**Making Science "Cool" and Desirable Strategy**
Permit me to expand upon our strategy with a fifth fundamental pillar, one I deem crucial not only for the growth of our initiative but also for its endurance and cultural resonance: making science "cool", attractive, and fundamentally modern, especially for the younger generations increasingly disillusioned with the current state of the world.

In this digital age, where apathy and cynicism often dominate public discourse, DeSci World has a unique opportunity to change the narrative, making science and participation in decentralized technologies the new form of "cool" activism. To achieve this, we will align with cultural icons, musicians, artists, and celebrities whom the youth admire and follow. These influencers will participate in campaigns that not only highlight the importance of science for our future but also show that getting involved with DeSci World is an act of rebellion against outdated structures that have contributed to the problems we face today.

Our promise must be clear. Every product we develop and every service we offer is imbued with exceptional value, intended to exceed our users' expectations. We commit to providing tools that not only meet their requirements but also delight them, thereby fostering deep satisfaction and long-term loyalty.

We must adopt a relational marketing approach to cultivate and deepen relationships with each segment of our diverse market. From academic institutions to independent laboratories, we personalize our interactions and solutions for each group, ensuring that each user feels valued and understood.

DeSci World must position itself at the forefront of science and technology as a pioneer of decentralization. We will use the theory of the diffusion of innovations to understand how our ideas and products propagate through different segments, adapting our strategies to accelerate adoption and maximize impact.

We will also delve into the behavior of our users to tailor our platforms and services, not only to meet their needs but to create memorable experiences that reinforce their emotional connection with DeSci World. We will communicate with our community only with their explicit consent, providing content that is relevant and valuable. This not only improves the effectiveness of our communication but also builds a foundation of trust and respect.

Our mission aligns with many global causes and agendas of the youth, particularly appealing to millennials and younger generations who value sustainability and social impact. Additionally, we will tailor our interactions on an individual level to offer unprecedented personalization, ensuring that each interaction is significant.

Lastly, I propose adopting a Blue Ocean Strategy, seeking to create a market where competition is irrelevant. Let's innovate in areas that have traditionally been ignored, opening new paths that redefine the value and experience in the world of science and technology.

It is clear to us, as we know and have experienced in institutions, even within our own team, how the scientific side has a somewhat particular vision of how we should approach researchers, but we must understand that in DeSci World there will be two levels, the content generators who are, by far, the most valuable and on a second level the users, the investors, the curious, those who are the vast majority, who have the power to help us build a respected and necessary image of decentralized science. A level filled with billions of people who, if we explain the importance of what DeSci World seeks to achieve, can find within themselves the element that motivates them to help, to promote, and even to invest by putting their grain of sand.

This strategy of not complaining, not bragging, just doing, simply doing something that is within your reach, if you don't know about science, help promote it, support it, your work is as important as that of the researchers and creators of science and that is invaluable.

These strategies are designed to work in synergy, creating a robust ecosystem that not only attracts investment and talent but also establishes DeSci World as an undisputed leader in the field of decentralized science. This is our path to growth and innovation, and with your support, I am confident that we will achieve our ambitious goals.

Five  fundamental pillars will help us achieve results:

Dear founding team and board members of DeSci World,

I address you today to present a comprehensive marketing strategy designed to catapult DeSci World to the forefront of decentralized science and blockchain technology. Our proposal focuses on two main fronts: strengthening our ecosystem by attracting significant intellectual contributions and positioning DeSci World as an attractive and promising investment within the cryptocurrency landscape.

First, let's address the pressing need to strengthen our knowledge base and resources. DeSci World must become a hub where top researchers, research collectives, universities, and institutes find invaluable value in sharing and enriching their research. By making our platform the epicenter of scientific innovation, we will not only expand our database with quality information but also strengthen the structure on which our entire business model is based: a token that gains value as our ecosystem is enriched. The strategy here is simple yet powerful: each new contribution to the ecosystem directly increases utility and, therefore, the value of the DeSci token, creating a virtuous circle of growth and valorization.

To achieve this, we must launch campaigns specifically targeted at academic institutions and thought leaders in the field of science and technology, demonstrating how DeSci World not only accelerates research through access to a global decentralized network but also offers new avenues for funding and collaboration through our innovative use of blockchain technology. This will be complemented by workshops, webinars, and presentations at key industry conferences, where we will show the transformative power of our platform.

The second strategic front is to attract investment, both from those who value the scientific and technological impact of our work and from crypto market speculators, who seek dynamic investment opportunities with exponential growth potential. Here, the key is to highlight not only the solidity and growth potential of our token within the cryptocurrency ecosystem but also its alignment with global investment trends in technology and sustainability. We will implement digital marketing campaigns that use precise data and success stories, highlighting how investing in DeSci World is investing in the future of science and technology.

Moreover, we will link DeSci World's mission with global movements towards sustainability and positive social change. This will not only increase our appeal to a young and conscious generation but also position DeSci World as a key player in the global movement towards more ethical and sustainable technological solutions.

To implement these strategies, I propose a clear and logical roadmap. We will begin with an intensive launch phase, focused on education and capturing key users to enrich our platform. This will be followed by a consolidation phase, where we will optimize our internal operations while expanding our presence in key markets. Finally, in our expansion phase, we aim to scale our operations, maximizing the return on investment for our stakeholders and solidifying our position as leaders in the decentralized science revolution.

This marketing strategy, designed not only to capture the attention of the scientific and technological world but also to resonate deeply with our investors and users, is based on a holistic approach that integrates various marketing strategies I have used throughout my professional career, ensuring that every action we take not only advances our mission but also cements our position as leaders in the field of decentralized science and blockchain technology.

In DeSci World, every innovation and service is meticulously designed to meet the specific needs of our users: scientists, researchers, and technology enthusiasts. Our services not only address their immediate needs but also solve complex problems, facilitating a platform that is both a collaborative workspace and a revolutionary idea incubator.
