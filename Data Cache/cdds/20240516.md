Desciworld development session Report 16/05/2024

Updates:

Locastic:

No updates this week 

Solidant:

we did a rundown through mickeys repo , ceramic setup and run steps

progress on the index network integration, encountered an issue with the sdk not being able to connect to chromaDB 

blocked by the need of having to go through them to create indexes, we discussed in the cvhannel and set that the general index will have a structure similar to this: 

```


text: HaikuType,

context: UnstructuredData,

explainer: UnstructuredSummary,

id: attestation

}

```

he mentioned he would try to get to generating the merkle tree from the scoring system before EOM too 


nerdDAO:

integrate mickeys repo (index network) into a new nerdDAO interface they're working on 

Internal: 


Eneko:


I have started the development of a dataviz python notebook to have a look at how the engrams are being used.

There are currently 3 clusters with test data. Atox and I thought one of them would be the ideal one to have a look at but I am having difficulties reading the data from Python. I believe the issue is that two of the objects have a string as an id, while the rest have an ObjectId. I think that itâ€™s because of this difference that I can only read two of the documents (those with the string as an id).

I did manage to read all of the data in another one of the clusters and have made a simple histogram to see how many times each engram has been used. I will make it so that on hover it shows you the associated text, and maybe even the prompts that used it.

Carlos:

started working on the interface project, progress on the UI side , projecting EOM , will add more details to the linear project for better visibility 

I wanted to use index network for this one but given the dependency of having to go back and forth with them  to get an index, Ill prolly just use mongoDB , still will have the segmented graphs feature, just not with index network, the initial idea is to have a couple indexes, some for RC demo usage and some for internal usage, pending a touch base with Eneko that is gonna be my product owner for this
