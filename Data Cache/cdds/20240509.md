Notes:  

housing thing is a RC with a specific ontology (tenants profile) and then you have other ontologies , one for the house and one for the events which is where these accomodations are tied to , basically if a house is available for what events and the brain as a tool to coordinate between these. People can query "whats happening in berlin where can i stay" and it pops up depending on their profile and the housing and events profiles embedding
