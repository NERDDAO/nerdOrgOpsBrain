2. **Impact on Future Funding**: By giving away a large percentage of our tokens now, we might struggle to secure additional funding in future rounds without excessively diluting our remaining token pool. This can hamper our growth and scalability, ultimately affecting the project's success.

### Misalignment of Interests

1. **Long-term Value Creation**: We believe that maintaining a larger token reserve allows us to strategically distribute tokens to partners, advisors, and future investors who can add significant value to DeSciWorld. A balanced distribution aligns everyone’s interests towards the long-term success of the project.

2. **Incentives for Performance**: A convertible note or similar structured deal ensures that you, as an investor, are directly incentivized by the project’s performance. This creates a win-win scenario where your return is tied to our success, promoting a collaborative effort towards achieving our milestones.

### Ensuring Fair Valuation

1. **Protecting Valuation Integrity**: Offering 4.5% of tokens for $100,000 implies a valuation that might not reflect the true potential and growth trajectory of DeSciWorld. A structured investment like a convertible note ensures that your investment is fairly valued based on future achievements and market conditions.

2. **Future Opportunities**: By structuring the investment in a way that includes discounts and priority returns, you benefit from both the upside potential of our tokens and the security of a guaranteed return, providing a balanced and fair approach to investment.

### Focusing on Profitability

1. **Guaranteed 200% ROI**: With the proposed convertible note structure, you are guaranteed a 200% return on your initial investment. This significant ROI aligns with your goal of making money and ensures a substantial profit.

2. **Priority Payment**: You will be the first to receive payments from the project's generated revenues, ensuring that you recover your initial investment and the guaranteed return before any other distributions are made. This minimizes your risk and maximizes your returns.

3. **Future Discount on Tokens**: You will receive a 20% discount on future token purchases, potentially leading to even greater earnings. This discount can significantly increase your profits as the token value appreciates.

### Enhancing Token Value

1. **Limiting Early Dilution**: By not diluting the token supply too early, we can ensure that the token value remains strong and attractive to future investors. This strategic approach can lead to a higher token value in subsequent funding rounds.

2. **Maximizing Future Gains**: By protecting the token's value now, we are setting the stage for greater appreciation in the future. This means that your discounted tokens can be worth significantly more, leading to higher overall profits.

### Conclusion

We are committed to ensuring that our investment structure is mutually beneficial and sustainable. We believe that the proposed alternative investment structures, such as the convertible note with enhanced return and priority payment, offer a fair, secure, and aligned pathway for both DeSciWorld and our valued investors.

Thank you for considering these proposals. We are open to discussing any of these options further to ensure they meet your expectations and investment criteria.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]  
DeSciWorld

### Investment Proposal: DeSciWorld

**Dear [VC's Name],**

Thank you for your interest in investing in DeSciWorld. We deeply appreciate your enthusiasm and support for our mission. Given our unique structure as a DAO, we’ve crafted an investment option that aligns with our goals and offers a fair return on your investment. This option is designed to protect the value of DeSciWorld while ensuring you receive significant benefits from your investment.

### Convertible Note with Enhanced Return and Priority Payment Option

#### Terms:
1. **Investment Amount**: $100,000
2. **Interest Rate**: 5% annual
3. **Conversion Discount**: 20% on token price at the time of the Token Generation Event (TGE)
4. **Valuation Cap**: $2,000,000
5. **Term**: 2 years
6. **Enhanced Return**: Guaranteed return of 200% on the initial investment
7. **Priority Payment**: The VC will receive payments from the project's generated revenues until the initial investment and the guaranteed return are fully paid out.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Discounted Token Purchase**:
   - **Valuation Cap Price Per Token**: \[ \text{Price Per Token at Valuation Cap} = \frac{2,000,000}{1,000,000} = $2.00 \]
   - **Discounted Price Per Token**: \[ 2.00 \times 0.80 = $1.60 \]
   - **Number of Tokens**: \[ \frac{100,000}{1.60} = 62,500 \]
   The VC can purchase 62,500 tokens at a discounted price of $1.60 each, which is 20% less than the valuation cap price.

2. **Enhanced Return**:
   - The VC is guaranteed a 200% return on their initial investment. This means the total return will be $300,000 ($100,000 initial investment + $200,000 return).

3. **Priority Payment**:
   - As soon as the project starts generating revenues, the VC will be the first to receive payments. This ensures that the VC recovers the initial investment and the 200% return before any other distributions are made.
   
4. **Future Discount on Tokens**:
   - The VC will receive a 20% discount on future token purchases until the cumulative discount rate matches the agreed 20% discounted rate from the initial token allocation.

### Benefits:
- **Secured Investment**: The priority payment ensures that you recover your investment and the guaranteed return promptly.
- **Attractive Return**: A 200% return provides a substantial incentive and aligns your success with ours.
- **Discounted Tokens**: The 20% discount on tokens ensures you receive a favorable entry point into DeSciWorld’s growing ecosystem.

### Conclusion

We believe this proposal offers a fair and balanced approach that aligns with our structure as a DAO and your investment goals. By choosing this option, you support the innovative mission of DeSciWorld and position yourself to benefit from our future success. We are confident that this structure will foster a strong and mutually beneficial partnership.

Thank you for considering this proposal. We are open to discussing it further to ensure it meets your expectations and investment criteria.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

### Reason Against Offering 4.5% of Tokens for $100,000

**Dear [VC's Name],**

We appreciate your interest and proposal to invest in DeSciWorld. However, offering 4.5% of our tokens for $100,000 presents significant challenges and potential drawbacks for both parties. Here’s why:

### Dilution of Token Value and Equity

1. **Early Stage Dilution**: At this early stage, offering 4.5% of our total tokens significantly dilutes the value for both current and future investors. This level of dilution can reduce the perceived value of our tokens and limit our ability to attract further investment at higher valuations.
