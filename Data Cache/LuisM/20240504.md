Subject: Invitation to Join the Advisory Board of DeSci World

Dear Mrs. Gabriela Ramos,
Office of the Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences
UNESCO

On behalf of the Board of Directors at DeSci World, I extend a heartfelt invitation for you to join our Advisory Board. At DeSci World, we are pioneering a transformative project in decentralized science through our Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol. Our mission is to place humanity at the center of the knowledge and artificial intelligence equation, recognizing and rewarding the contributions of those at the forefront of knowledge creation.

Your distinguished role at UNESCO aligns seamlessly with our vision, as both our endeavors strive to foster global educational and scientific engagement. We believe your expertise and influence could greatly assist DeSci World in forging partnerships with institutions ready to adopt innovative scientific platforms like ours.

DeSci World is designed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), leveraging token economics to facilitate a fair and transparent ecosystem where scientists and knowledge creators can thrive. Our platform not only aims to eliminate the perennial chase for funding but also enhances scientific engagement through gamification and passive income opportunities, thus accelerating human knowledge like never before.

We are confident that your guidance will be invaluable in navigating strategic paths and expanding our reach globally. By joining us, you will play a pivotal role in shaping a future where science and equity flourish hand in hand.

We are pleased to offer you a position within DeSci World's DAO, which includes NFTs and Tokens that will be granted over time. We understand that the realms of science and education often do not attract substantial private or governmental investment. Despite these challenges, our commitment over the past two years has been unyielding in raising the necessary funds to develop this transformative technology.

Although we are currently unable to provide monetary compensation, we believe the long-term value of the tokens and the legacy of your involvement will immensely benefit both you and the global community. As a member of our Advisory Board, your guidance will help steer this noble cause towards empowering millions of young people, scientists, and knowledge creators worldwide.

Additionally, we propose the development of a Research Collective under your leadership at UNESCO, focusing on AI ethics. This initiative would further align with your work at the Social and Human Sciences office, enhancing the global impact of PoK.

Your role would not require a substantial time commitment, just periodic guidance, strategic introductions to institutions, and advocacy for our mission. We aim to offer our protocol to these institutions at no cost, ensuring that the adoption of PoK can proceed smoothly and beneficially.

Your support for this noble effort will not only foster significant positive change but will also leave an enduring legacy in the advancement of decentralized science. We deeply appreciate your consideration and look forward to possibly welcoming you to our team.

Warm regards,

Joshua Bate
Founder - Chief Decentralizer
